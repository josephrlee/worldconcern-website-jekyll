#Table Host
##Overview & Registration

Thank you for your interest in hosting a table at the 2019 Transform Gala on Saturday, September 14, 2019.  By hosting a table at this event, you play a critical role in supporting families beyond the end of the road. Your partnership is key to moving families and communities beyond survival and into the abundant life God intends for them, where the thirsty drink clean water, the hungry have food, children learn, the enslaved are free, the hopeless find peace with God. 
 
We are here to help you fill your table and ensure an exceptional experience for you and your guests. Below are some resources and information about being a table host for Transform 2019.
