story: "Lolmodooni lives in Northern Kenya with her little ones. Every morning she
  wakes up before dawn and collects her water jugs. **She walks for three hours one
  way to a small pond**, or if the animals are overcrowding, a dry riverbed further
  away. Stooping down to fill her water jugs, Lolmodooni collects as much water as
  she can for her family. Manisi, one of her children, often comes with her to help
  collect their daily water. \n\nLolmodooni knows that giving this water to her family
  will make them sick. **It’s full of parasites and bacteria that upset their stomachs**
  and steal the nutrients they need to grow and be healthy.\n\n**For Lolmodooni and
  Manisi’s family, clean water can change everything.** With clean water, she will
  no longer have to walk for miles. Her children will no longer get sick. Her family
  will have more time to care for their livestock and participate in income-earning
  opportunities. And, long-term, Lolmodooni and families like hers will help their
  village overcome poverty."
