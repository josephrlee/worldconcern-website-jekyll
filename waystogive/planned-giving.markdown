  ### Why we give

  Curt and Nora Nichols gave their first donation to World Concern 30 years ago. They were newly married and Curt had just started his career in the technology industry.

  Fast-forward three decades. They’ve raised four children, Curt recently retired, and the family has made a huge impact in the lives of the poor through their generous donations to World Concern.

  “It’s so evident there’s such a great need,” said Curt. “Christ commanded us to be generous with what we have. I’ve seen World Concern’s work they do in places of great need, and I’ve seen the impact on people’s lives. It’s an organization of quality people committed to Christ who want to help others less fortunate than themselves.”

  Curt and Nora want to continue helping the poor even after they’re gone. In addition to leaving an inheritance to their children, they’ve included a gift for World Concern in their will.

  “It’s pretty simple. You don’t get to take your worldly possessions and treasures to heaven. You never see a U-haul or an armored truck following your hearse,” said Curt. “Somebody’s going to get your money. Wouldn’t you rather plan and direct who will get your life’s legacy?

  “World Concern’s mission is something we believe in strongly. We want to continue that support with a long-term gift.”

extra: "<!-- Gifts for Today -->\n    <div id=\"securities\" class=\"reveal-modal
  small\" data-reveal >\n      <h3>Appreciated Securities or Real Estate</h3>\n      <p>Publicly
  traded stocks, real estate and even closely-held stock all provide an extra tax
  benefit if you have owned the asset for more than a year.  In addition to receiving
  a federal income tax deduction, you may also avoid tax on your capital gains.\n
  \     </p>\n     <p><a href=\"/waystogive/planned/stocks\" title=\"Learn More\"
  class=\"secondary button\">Learn how to make a stock donation »</a></p> \n      <a
  class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"barginsale\"
  class=\"reveal-modal small\" data-reveal  >\n      <h3>Bargin Sale</h3>\n      <p>If
  you are interested in donating part of the proceeds from the sale of a property,
  a bargain sale might more effectively accomplish your goals.  In a bargain sale,
  World Concern purchases your piece of property at a substantially reduced price.
  Ultimately you will receive some cash from the sale portion, be able to claim an
  income tax deduction from the gift portion of the transaction and avoid some or
  all taxes on your capital gains.\n      </p>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
  \   </div>\n    <div id=\"leadtrust\" class=\"reveal-modal small\"  data-reveal
  >\n      <h3>Charitable Lead Trusts</h3>\n      <p>A charitable lead trust (CLT)
  helps you provide resources for your favorite ministry and receive tax benefits
  without giving up assets that you want your family to receive some day.  A CLT may
  be funded with cash, stocks or property.  When the trust is established you chose
  a set period of years or the lifetime(s) of close family members during which the
  trust makes payments to the ministry you have designated.  At the conclusion of
  the term, the assets in the trust are passed to you, a family member or other beneficiary
  you’ve selected.\n      </p>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
  \   </div>\n    <!-- Gifts for Tomorrow -->\n    <div id=\"beneficiary\" class=\"reveal-modal
  small\"  data-reveal >\n      <h3>Beneficiary Designation</h3>\n      <p>Naming
  World Concern as a beneficiary is a flexible way to provide future resources after
  you no longer need them.  The designation is easy to change and can be split between
  multiple beneficiaries, including your heirs.  Since non-profits are exempt from
  the income taxes that would be owed by your heirs, some assets are better to donate
  from a tax standpoint.  A beneficiary designation can be made in connection with:\n
  \     </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>IRAs and other qualified retirement plans</li>\n
  \       <li>Bank and brokerage accounts</li>\n        <li>Commercial annuity contracts</li>\n
  \       <li>Life Insurance</li>\n      </ul>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
  \   </div>\n    <div id=\"bequest\" class=\"reveal-modal small\"  data-reveal >\n
  \     <h3>Bequest</h3>\n      <p>Bequests can be tailored to meet your goals by
  taking one of many forms, including a specific dollar amount, a specific asset or
  a percentage of your residuary estate. Your gift may also be designated to specific
  ministry or even to establish an endowment. Sample language may look like:\n      </p>\n
  \     <ul>\n        <li>“I give the sum of $______ to World Concern of Seattle,
  WA or its successor.”</li>\n        <li>“I give _____ shares of stock to World Concern,
  of Seattle, WA or its successor.”</li>\n        <li>“I give ____ percentage of my
  residual estate to World Concern of Seattle, WA or its successor to establish the
  John and Sue Smith Endowment.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
  \   </div>\n    <div id=\"estate\" class=\"reveal-modal small\"  data-reveal >\n
  \     <h3>Retained Life Estate</h3>\n      <p>A retained life estate may be the
  right way for you to give if you want to donate your residence, vacation home or
  farm to your favorite ministry but keep the right to occupy or otherwise use your
  property for the rest of your life.  Your gift will provide you with a charitable
  tax deduction for the appraised value of your home minus the present value of your
  right to continue to live there and possibly provide additional tax savings by removing
  the property from your estate.\n      </p>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
  \   </div>\n    <!-- Gifts that Pay You Income -->\n    <div id=\"annuity\" class=\"reveal-modal
  small\"  data-reveal >\n      <h3>Charitable Gift Annuity</h3>\n      <p>A charitable
  gift annuity is the oldest, simplest, and most popular life income gift.  It provides
  you or someone else you designate with fixed annual payments for the rest of your
  or their lives. Your gift annuity will provide some benefit for World Concern over
  the life of annuity, and when the gift annuity ends the entire remaining balance
  of your contribution will go to support World Concern’s work and mission.  In addition
  to guaranteeing you a reliable stream of payments that are favorably taxed for many
  years, a charitable gift annuity also provides a charitable tax deduction.\n      </p>\n
  \     <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"remaindertrust\"
  class=\"reveal-modal small\"  data-reveal >\n      <h3>Charitable Remainder Trust</h3>\n
  \     <p>With a charitable remainder trust, you (or others you designate) can receive
  annual income from the asset you give to the trust, either for life or for a set
  numbers of years.  At the time the trust is funded, you will receive an immediate
  charitable tax deduction and avoid possible capital gains taxes.  When the trust
  terminates, the remainder of the trust will be used to continue the work of World
  Concern while avoiding possible estate taxes.\n      </p>\n      <a class=\"close-reveal-modal\">&#215;</a>\n
