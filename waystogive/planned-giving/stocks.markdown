<p class="large">The donation may be made in two ways. You may have your brokerage firm electronically transfer shares from your account to CRISTA Ministries (our parent organization) account.</p>

Or if you hold the certificates, you may bring them to World Concern and we will arrange the transfer.

To ensure proper tax receipting, please be sure to let us know that you made the transfer, the company name of the stock you’re donating, and how many shares and notify Tom Burley of your transfer at [tburley@crista.net](mailto:tburley@crista.net?subject=World Concern Stock Donations "Email Tom Burley").

If you have any questions please call World Concern Donor Relations at [(206) 546-7201](tel:(206) 546-7201).
