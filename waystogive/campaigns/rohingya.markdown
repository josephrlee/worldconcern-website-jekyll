story: "### A Survivor's Story\n\nAaid fled one nightmare only to arrive in another.
  \n\nAfter witnessing his wife and grandson brutally killed while trying to escape
  their home, Aaid ran for three long days to reach Bangladesh. \n \nNow inside the
  Kutupalong refugee camp, the sheer volume of people is overwhelming. Aaid, with
  an orphaned child from his village in tow, stumble through the crowd of new arrivals
  to claim a space on the outskirts. Small tarps cover the hillsides for miles, and
  as they walk Aaid notices human waste flowing in streams along the path.  \n \nAaid
  has no food, no shelter, and no access to clean water. The refugees arrived so quickly
  there is now a shortage of critically needed emergency supplies.  Instead of finding
  refuge and peace, Aaid and this little boy are alone and without help."

World Concern is at the center of what is now the fastest-growing refugee crisis in the world.
 
Since violence broke out in Rakhine State, Myanmar, in August 2017, nearly 700,000 Rohingya refugees have fled to Bangladesh. 
 
Mothers, fathers, and children ran for their lives with no time to take anything with them. Food, clothing, livelihoods, even beloved family members - all were left behind. Nightmarish conditions greet them, but there is nowhere else to go. Rohingya refugees are among the most marginalized people in the world.  

Because the camps are so overcrowded, many newly-arrived families are forced to the outskirts. Basic necessities such as food and shelter are severely lacking in these areas. 

To save these refugee families, emergency supplies must be trucked 20 miles, but the road ends before supplies can get to them…

You are needed to walk alongside the Rohingya and provide critical aid to the families who need it most. With your support, these desperate families will receive emergency supplies including shelter kits and hygiene materials.
