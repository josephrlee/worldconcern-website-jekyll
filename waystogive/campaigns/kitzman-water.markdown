        “Now it’s easier to learn because we have water. This water tastes better because it is clean. In school we were taught about hygiene—how to clean our school area, how to clean our houses, and how to clean ourselves. Now we are healthy.”
– Mohamad, 14 Somalia

<p class="large">Kitzman's Culligan Water and World Concern are partnering to provide 20,000 people with clean water over 10 years. For every new customer, Kitzman's Culligan Water will donate a year’s supply of clean water for one person.</p>

> “I am moved by the difficult reality people face all around the world because of unsafe water to drink. Providing clean water is affordable and makes a profound difference.  I want to be a part of transforming as many lives as I can,” said Kitzman's Culligan Water CEO Rob Kitzman.

World Concern is reaching extremely remote communities where no other organizations are serving. In most of the impoverished places where World Concern works, meeting needs starts with water.
