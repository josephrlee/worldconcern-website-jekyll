banner_title: Seek Out and Stop Child Trafficking
banner_subtitle: Every single year, more than one million children are taken from
  their homes and communities—some are as young as five-years-old. These precious
  girls and boys are then sold into forced labor or the sex trade, abused and exploited
  for the perverse desires of evil men. <br/><br/>Children living in poverty are the
  most vulnerable. Obligated to help support their families, they drop out of school
  far too early to find work. Unaware of the dangers, they are easily lured by promises
  of high-paying jobs, but instead become modern day slaves.

  ### Priya’s Story

  Living in a village in Sri Lanka, this precious girl lost her father during the country’s brutal civil war. Left to care for two young daughters without an income, Priya’s mother made the difficult decision to go abroad and search for work; but no one has heard from her since.

  Suddenly, Priya was alone and terribly vulnerable.

  Concerned neighbors used the S.O.S. hotline—which your gift helps make possible—to raise the alarm and notify us that Priya was unsupervised, and not going to school. Instead, Priya was with her grandmother brewing illegal alcohol, then selling it late at night to men in the village.

  As you can imagine, this put Priya at great risk.

  Thanks to you, Priya is now involved in World Concern’s Child Protection program. She is living in her village, and she is safe. Your gift will also help ensure that Priya returns to school so that she has a path out of poverty, and hope for a brighter future. But most of all, you’ll be keeping her safe.
