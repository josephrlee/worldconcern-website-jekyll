outsider: "The Rohingya are one of the world's few stateless people groups, viewed
  as outsiders by both Bangladesh and Myanmar. Until recently, Myanmar hosted the
  majority of the Rohingya population in Rhakine state, a territory in the country’s
  northeastern corner. \n\nFollowing decades of increasing persecution, on August
  25, 2017, extreme violence broke out, [forcing Rohingya families to flee](http://humanitarian.worldconcern.org/2017/10/26/need-know-rohingya-refugee-crisis/).
  Survivors report close friends and relatives brutally raped and killed while attempting
  to escape and entire villages burned to the ground. \n \nThe survivors of this initial
  wave of violence found themselves without food, water, or shelter as they fled in
  search of safety. For many, the journey lasted days—some even weeks—either running
  through thick mud and dense forests, or daring to cross unsafe waters in boats.
  Those who were not strong enough to keep up fell behind, left to the unfeeling brutality
  of their attackers. Some people narrowly escaped death in their homes only to drown
  within sight of freedom.   \n\nBy the time Rohingya refugees arrived at the entrance
  of one of the numerous overcrowded refugee camps, it had been days since they'd
  slept or eaten. Hoping to find rest and security, the refugees are instead faced
  with the harsh reality that not only are they homeless, they have nothing to their
  name.  \n\nIt was at this point that [World Concern](https://worldconcern.org/),
  a Christian global relief and development organization, first began to address the
  needs of newly-arrived refugees in Bangladesh. \n\nTargeting people who had been
  left out of aid distributions, Chris Sheach, World Concern’s Director of Disaster
  Response, noted this situation is the worst he’s seen in his career. “We reached
  out to people who had not had a roof over their heads in six weeks since they left
  Myanmar.”\n\nWith a history of serving in Bangladesh for over 25 years, World Concern
  is uniquely equipped to meet the needs of Rohingya refugees. \n\n“This is exactly
  the kind of crisis at the very heart of World Concern’s mission. We seek out the
  most vulnerable and meet them right where they are,” said World Concern President
  Jacinta Tegman."
today: "## The Rohingya Today\n\nEven to the most seasoned humanitarian, the current
  state of the Kutupalong refugee camp many Rohingya now call home is shocking. Mothers
  fetch water from streams contaminated by nearby latrines. Then, they pour the same
  water into cracked plastic cups to quench the thirst of their children. \n \n<figure

  were home to about 200,000 Rohingya refugees. Now, the Rohingya refugee crisis is
  the fastest-growing in the world.</figcaption></figure> \n\nAccording to the International
  Organization for Migration (IOM), [over 73% of Rohingya are now living in new, spontaneous
  settlements](https://www.iom.int/news/rohingya-arrivals-bangladesh-hit-655000-winter-weather-brings-new-shelter-health-challenges).
  The refugee camps in Bangladesh that served over 200,000 Rohingya prior to the influx
  were massively unprepared for the hundreds of thousands of refugees that poured
  over the border beginning in August 2017. Today, almost the entire Rohingya population
  resides in some sort of refugee camp. \n\n<figure class=\"right medium-6 large-4

  when he grows up so he can teach others how to be honest. </figcaption></figure>
  \n\nHumanitarian aid agencies such as World Concern are preparing to meet the needs
  of over 1.2 million people in the greater Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh. Without
  a comprehensive response, the potential for massive loss of life is high. Deadly
  diseases are a constant threat – and soon the rainy season will begin, causing open
  sewage lines to overflow and spread throughout the camp. \n\nNot only is the camp
  teeming with filth and [diseases like diphtheria and cholera](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/01/27/581070933/rare-disease-finds-fertile-ground-in-rohingya-refugee-camps),
  but behind the eyes of every Rohingya survivor is a depth of hopelessness hard to
  convey. \n\nIt's difficult to process the sheer magnitude of this crisis. Not only
  in terms of the physical response to need, but the lasting emotional distress of
  a generation that must be reckoned with."
story: "### Jahira’s Story \n\n*As he was being pulled away Jahira’s brother cried,
  “Dear sister, please forgive me, I’m very sure I’m going to die.”*\n\n\"Since I
  lost my parents I haven't been happy. If the soul of my parents is missing, I keep
  thinking 'why am I not dead?'\"\n\nJahira watched her home in Myanmar burn down
  before her eyes. But before she could flee along with her neighbors, her parents
  already shot to death, Jahira and three other women were grabbed and taken. \n\nEver
  since that night, each time she lies down or closes her eyes, Jahira relives each
  moment of horror over and over again. \n\nAfter recounting her story, Jahira’s strength
  gave way to reality, and she lifted her scarf to hide her tears. Her body may be
  healing, but the mind is another matter entirely."

life: "## Life After Death \n\nNasima* plays leapfrog with her friends in the camp,
  laughing and smiling when it’s her turn to jump. In a place overshadowed by hopelessness,
  her vibrant personality stands out. \nBut as soon as she begins to recount her escape
  from Myanmar, Nasima’s smile disappears.\nWatching her one would think she’s reciting
  a list of facts – not describing the death of her immediate family. \n\nThe night
  her family drowned, Nasima assumed she was going to die, too. \nHaving escaped the
  massacre in her village, Nasima, her father, mother and three siblings arrived on
  the banks of the Naf River. Along with seventy or so others, they crowded onto a
  fishing boat and set off. \n\nBut they never made it across. \n\n> ## “We were seven
  family members in the boat, but six drowned….” <br/>—Nasima, 8\n\nHalfway through
  the journey, the boat capsized, drowning nearly all aboard. Nasima struggled to
  stay afloat, grasping at flimsy pieces of debris. Finally, she grabbed hold of something
  solid. It was only when she hoisted herself above the water did she realize her
  life raft was a dead body."

  ## Invisible Wounds

  For generations, the questions of where they will live and how long they can endure such marginalization have remained unanswered for Rohingya people.

  Opportunities for education, the ability to go outside the refugee camps, and access to food have been severely limited. Without any degree of certainty in their day to day activities, Rohingya mothers, fathers, and children live in a continuous state of anxiety within the confines of the camp. This daily stress, now complicated with exposure to high levels of trauma, is creating a breeding ground for increased mental distress among Rohingya refugees.

  “I wish I could die. I really worry, thinking about my future. When I remember what happened, I can’t eat. Even when I eat rice my chest burns,” said Jahira, comparing her life in Myanmar to her current situation in Kutupalong.

  Children and young adults, much like Jahira and Nasima, are most at-risk for suffering from long-term effects of trauma.

  “This population has been traumatized to a degree that I’ve never seen,” said Andrew Pendleton, Emergency Response Coordinator for World Concern, recounting his experience working among the Rohingya in Kutupalong. “I’ve been a refugee worker for the past 40 years globally, and this situation we find ourselves running with here is unprecedented.”

  Not only are children witnesses to horrific violence, but many endured it themselves. From burning, physical abuse, to near-drownings - the stories are endless.
life_continued: "Two months later, she’s still scared.  \n\n“My mom is coming as a
  ghost to get me…she’s saying ‘Where is your sister?’”\n\n<div class=\"youtube\">\n<div

  had attempted to save her sister from drowning but didn’t have the strength. “I
  was trying, but how is it possible?”\n\nNow, her mother haunts her dreams. \n\nWith
  little to do in the camp, Nasima thinks of her parents and siblings often, missing
  them with an intensity disguised by her outgoing nature.  \n\nImages of violence
  and horror are now permanently etched into Nasima’s mind, and many children living
  in the Kutupalong camp share pieces of her story. As a result, anxiety runs deep
  among youth in the camp."

  ## A Cry for Help

  World Concern is answering the cries of Rohingya children and families in distress. During the initial wave of arrivals in Bangladesh, World Concern, coordinating with Integral Alliance partners, put together a rapid response to the crisis.

  “My job here is to find our niche, to find the most vulnerable, and the most desperate,” explained Andrew.

  After making the trek to the Kutupalong extension camp, much of it inaccessible by vehicle, the team went family by family to seek out the most vulnerable, hearing their stories and assessing their most critical needs. Emergency shelter materials and hygiene kits were soon distributed to these families.

  Not only were the physical gaps observed, but, according to Andrew, the “gaps in their souls.” Recognizing the depths of emotional pain in many refugees, plans were set in motion to address this invisible crisis.

  Children are most at-risk for the effects of trauma, but also violence and abuse. With over half the camp under the age of 18, the way forward was clear.

  “We’ve started to find areas where we can work with girls and boys. They’re very idle, very bored, and need something to do. They need to fill their days with something productive. We want to work with the community in a holistic way,” said Andrew.

  Recreation areas and [community engagement opportunities](https://www.unhcr.or.th/en/news/general/rohingyafleetobangladesh/communityhelprohingya) are a few ways World Concern plans to address this gap in response.

  From soccer games to a safe place to play, the goal is to create as much of a “normal” environment as possible. Children need the chance to be children – to run, laugh, and play with their peers. Once a sense of routine and security is established, children are able to safely process the emotional trauma many have been struggling with, alone, for months. Here, true healing can begin.

  Jacinta Tegman, president of World Concern, visited with Rohingya families on a recent trip to hear their stories first-hand.

  “The trauma that these little children have experienced, no one should have to witness, but we have an entire generation in this camp that needs our help desperately. They need someone to hear their story,” she said about the needs she witnessed in the camp.

  It was inside a black tarp and bamboo shelter, sitting cross-legged on a worn mat, where Jacinta first met Jahira. Sitting side by side, Jahira recounted the horrors she suffered.

  Jacinta hopes that World Concern’s response will impact Jahira and others like her in a transformative way. World Concern wants to meet not only Jahira’s physical and emotional needs, but the needs of each refugee they have the opportunity to serve.

  “My hope and prayer was for her in some small way, that even as I put my arms around her, she could feel the love of God.”

Jahira* lives alone. 
 
In a refugee camp where personal space is a luxury, her isolation only serves to highlight the traumatic reality of Rohingya refugees – loved ones, livelihoods, and futures are gone. 
 
Even the clothes she wears are not her own, given to her when she arrived in Bangladesh. 

> ## “Everyone said we don’t belong. We have no place, no shelter, no identity…” — Jahira, 20
 
"I lost my parents, I lost my house… I have pain all over my body," said Jahira, recounting her harrowing journey from Myanmar. So high was the adrenaline coursing through her, it wasn’t until reaching Kutupalong, a refugee camp, did Jahira realize some of her teeth were broken. 
 
Now, Jahira wants someone to listen. Someone to hear her story, and understand this crisis is not new, nor are the effects purely physical. The true crisis goes much deeper, to the core of each Rohingya survivor.
