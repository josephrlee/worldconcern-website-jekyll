<p class="large"><img src="/uploads/FY17-Give-a-Goat-Progress-Bar-450.png" alt="450 Goats Given!" class="left large-5 small-6" />Has anyone ever “gotten your goat”? <a href="http://www.campbellautogroup.com/mw-campbell-cares-campaign" title="In Partnership With Campbell Nissan & Volkswagen">Campbell Volkswagen &amp; Nissan</a>, in Edmonds and Everett, wants to make that happen—in a good way. For every vehicle purchased during this giving season, Campbell will donate a goat to a child or family in need through World Concern’s <a href="https://globalgiftguide.org/?utm_source=campbell&utm_campaign=UWC20GGG&utm_medium=Website&utm_content=Campbell+Cares&utm_term=Appeal" title="Visit the Global Gift Guide">Global Gift Guide</a>.</p>

“Campbell VW-Nissan has enjoyed a great partnership over the years with World Concern,” said Kurt Campbell. “Goats are a very tangible way for us to help people suffering from dire economic circumstances in some the poorest countries in the world.”

Kurt’s concern for hurting people led him to visit Sri Lanka with World Concern. One of the most significant aspects of the work Kurt observed was how World Concern staff pays attention to individual people, walking with them through their struggles. “We’re affecting people’s lives and it’s wonderful,” he said. <a href="http://humanitarian.worldconcern.org/2016/12/01/local-business-helping-drive-away-poverty-one-car-time/" title="Read More">(Click here to read more about Kurt’s story.)</a>

Goats change lives—no kidding! Children receive better nutrition and income from the milk. The sale of a baby goat can net enough income for an entire year of school.

Stop into any Campbell dealership between now and the end of the year, and help transform lives this holiday season with your purchase.
