Ninety-five percent of our nearly 500 employees are nationals of the countries where we serve and are paid directly by World Concern. However, a small number of staff from other areas — mostly the U.S. — serve in deputized positions which require them to raise support from individual donors for at least part of their income. They serve in key leadership roles or work in unique capacities, so your investment goes a long way.

We invite you to get to know them — read their bios and join their adventures through their newsletters. Then support one of them directly with financial support and prayers.
