<span class="highlight">With your partnership</span>, World Concern's efforts reach deep into the most remote corners of the planet, where climate and geography, societal instability and scarce infrastructure create incredible challenges to the people living there.

We seek to fully immerse ourselves in the interests of the people we serve, enabling us to plan, scale, and develop programs tailored to each particular community's circumstance.

We ask the people we help to serve with us &mdash; building the programs they need &mdash; enabling them to realize their God-given potential.
