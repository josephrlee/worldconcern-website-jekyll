banner_subtitle: Despite its natural beauty and rich historical heritage, 80% of the
  Haiti’s population lives on less than $1.25 a day, making it the poorest country
  in the Western Hemisphere.  A devastating earthquake struck Haiti on January 12,
  2010, claiming more than 200,000 lives and leaving millions homeless.  Communities
  remain vulnerable to disasters, like hurricanes and flooding. Parents in Haiti struggle
  to earn enough to feed and educate their children.
who_we_serve: We’re able to reach the most vulnerable in remote areas of Haiti.  Our
  desire is to serve communities who often receive little or no outside assistance.  Although
  we seek to empower all people, we focus particularly on meeting the needs of women
  and children.

  #### Meet Charité

  Pastor Charité is a pastor and school principal in the village of La Pointe in northern Haiti. His church of 100 people meets faithfully each week in the same local school building where he works.

  The school building was built by World Concern in partnership with community members, who identified the old structure as a hazard. “The old building was very weak,” he explained.

  Each year hurricanes sweep over Haiti, destroying homes, businesses, and entire villages. Thankfully, the new building in La Pointe was up and operating just before large storm destroyed the former building. “This new building is much safer,” he said.

  World Concern paid the students tuition and provided them with school supplies for the new year. Although challenges remain in La Pointe, and many communities in Haiti, this new structure is an example of reducing the risk to natural disasters.
