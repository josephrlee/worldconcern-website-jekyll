banner_subtitle: A beautiful and relatively peaceful country, Kenya has for decades
  been a haven to thousands of refugees from neighboring conflict stricken countries.
  The influx of refugees, combined with a history of extreme poverty puts a strain
  on Kenya’s limited resources and has exposed Kenya to attacks from militant groups.
  Among those in greatest need are women and children in rural areas who struggle
  to access basic health care facilities, enough food, education, and clean water.

  ### “My dream is to see our group eradicate poverty in this village”

  Born and raised in the remote Kenyan village of Olomayiana, Naishuro was raised with the communally shared knowledge that livestock are equivalent to money and an individual’s earnings should be invested toward their purchase.

  Six years ago, with the assistance of World Concern, Naishuro and ten other women from Olomayiana joined forces and formed a women’s group. They began frequently meeting together in order to discuss village problems and feasible solutions.

  “Since we founded the women’s group, there has been development in our village,” shares Naishuro. “Many women from the village have approached us asking to join.”

  In the last year, World Concern partnered with Naishuro’s group to create an Accumulated Savings Credit Association (ASCA).

  “Since the ASCA was formed, we now save our money rather than spending it on animals – we use these savings to lend out loans to members of the group,” explained Naishuro. “I used my loan to buy materials to construct a new home. I am proud of my savings because I know I will use them to pay for my children’s school fees.”

  “Since World Concern came, we have learned that both men and women can be the breadwinners,” shares Nairshuro. “My dream is to see our group eradicate poverty in this village.”
who_we_serve: In Kenya, we serve the poorest and most vulnerable of the population—those
  who live in remote villages or are not reached by other assistance.
