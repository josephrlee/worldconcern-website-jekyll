banner_title: Keeping kids safe is a top priority in places where children are vulnerable
  to trafficking, child labor, early marriage, and other forms of exploitation and
  abuse. Poverty forces families who cannot afford to feed and educate their children
  to consider child marriage and makes “too good to be true” job offers hard to resist.
  Our goal is prevention. We work to educate families and offer alternatives.

  Incredible strides have been made to prevent trafficking in Thongkouang village in Laos. In the past, many young people in the village either crossed or considered crossing over the Thailand border in search of work. They heard stories of high paying jobs that were likely scams.

  This dangerous action often leads to tragedies like trafficking, insurmountable debt, or for some, never being seen or heard from again.

  To tackle this, community members who have been trained on trafficking prevention are working tirelessly to keep the youth and most vulnerable members of the community from crossing the Thai border. Thanks to their hard work educating kids and parents about the dangers of trafficking, fewer youth are crossing the border.

  And because of savings groups started in the village, vulnerable families are now investing in small businesses like rice fields and broom making, and the youth in the village joined vocational training supported by World Concern.

  _“I want to see the youth and children in my village be safe from migration and able to find a good job,”_ said Village Development Councilmember Mr. Yuen. _“Now my dream has come true.”_

  These incredible, positive changes for the youth and most vulnerable in Thongkouang village would not be possible without support from people like you.
