banner_subtitle: Bangladesh is home to 163 million people, yet is only about the size
  of Iowa. While the capital, Dhaka, and other urban centers have seen significant
  economic growth, Bangladesh remains a very poor country. The majority of the country
  lies less than 10 meters above sea level, which leaves much of the population vulnerable
  to flooding.

who_we_serve: Children are the most vulnerable victims of poverty, malnutrition and
  disease. Many are also illiterate, which prevents them from ever being able to earn
  a wage above the poverty level. Women living in this male-dominated society have
  less access to education and fair credit, yet are often the sole providers of their
  families.

  #### Meet Abdul

  Abdul struggled to feed his family, working long, strenuous hours as a rickshaw driver in the city. He couldn’t afford to send his children to school, leaving them with little hope for a better future.

  Since World Concern helped Abdul start a fish farming business, things have changed dramatically. With our help, Abdul received fish nets, feed and supplies, and learned how to successfully raise fish for food and income. His business prospered and eventually he was able to buy land for his family and build a home. Now, he saves at least $500 every year. He’s been able to buy cows and build wealth. Most importantly, his family has plenty of healthy food to eat.

  Abdul told us he feels blessed and grateful for a chance to live a better life.
