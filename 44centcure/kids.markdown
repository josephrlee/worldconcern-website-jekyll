            Why Is This Important?
          </h3>
          <p>
            More than 1/3 of the world's population suffers from worms, with the most intense infections in children and the poor. Infection can negatively impact all aspects of a child's development. Worms are often ingested as eggs through contaminated water. They grow in the intestines of their host and cause many problems.

            How We Help
          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li>We begin with a chewable dose of Membendazole (de-worming medication) and vitamin A
            </li>
            <li>The medication kills the worms in the intestinal tract and the vitamin supplement helps it work
            </li>
            <li>Vitamin A increases immunity and helps prevent blindness
            </li>
            <li>We return in six months for another dose
            </li>
            <li>We educate people on the importance of good sanitation and hygiene in order to keep the worms away
            </li>
            <li>We build latrines in villages and teach hand washing. Often, children learn about germs for the first time
            </li>
            <li>Whenever possible, we also build clean water systems to prevent the worms from returning
            </li>
          </ol>

story_copy: "### Transforming the lives of children through generosity\n\n**How the
  44-Cent Cure Children's Outreach Project impacted one church's children's ministry**\n\nThe
  kids in Edgewood Baptist's VBS program collected coins and raised $2,834! That means
  more than 6,000 children will be cured from parasites because of one group of kids!\n\nThe
  project also made a lasting impression on the hearts of the children involved. Here's
  what Melissa Ellis of Edgewood Baptist had to say:\n\n> \"I’ve been coordinating
  the missions project for our church’s VBS for over 10 years. This year’s 44-Cent
  Cure project really touched our kids’ hearts. I have never seen them connect with
  a project like they did this year.\n> \n> The idea that they could individually
  make a difference in the life of a child really impacted them. The materials were
  excellent and really opened the kids’ eyes to the realities of life for many children
  in the world. I had kids in tears wanting to know if they could bottle up our water
  and send it to kids. They really cared.\n> \n> This is a project that will hopefully
  impact them for life and develop in them a heart for reaching out to people all
  over the world with the love of Christ.\""

**[The 44-Cent Cure Children’s Outreach Project](/uploads/World-Concern-Kids44CentCure-VBS-Booklet.pdf)** offers kids the opportunity to help hundreds or thousands of children around the world by collecting coins.

Approximately 40% of the world’s children are affected by intestinal parasites, usually caused by dirty water and poor sanitation. Parasites affect a child’s development and cause hunger, nausea and lack of energy. In about 60,000 severe cases each year, they take lives.

For Vacation Bible School mission projects, Bible clubs and Children’s ministries, the 44-Cent Cure Children’s Outreach Project gives children an opportunity to make a significant impact through hands-on experience, while teaching them compassion for other children around the world, especially those living in poverty.
