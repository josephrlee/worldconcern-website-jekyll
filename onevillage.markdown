For $39 a month, you'll take part in this transformation, knowing lives are being improved in lasting ways. Working with
leaders and community members, we help identify the specific needs of the village and the community takes part in its
own transformation. While each village is unique, some of the most critical needs in the areas where we work include:

<div class="panel">
  <h3><img src="/assets/images/focus-icons/clean-water.svg" class="left" alt="Water"> Clean Water &amp; Sanitation</h3>
  <p>Access to clean water is a top priority, and it is vital to the health and survival of families. Building wells,
    latrines, and teaching hygiene skills is the first step in improving the health of children and families.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3><img src="/assets/images/focus-icons/education.svg" class="left" alt="Education"> Education</a></h3>
  <p>Many villages where we work don't have a school, and children walk for miles to the nearest school, or the school
    is inadequate. Most families cannot afford even small school fees or uniforms for their children. Knowing that
    education is the key to a better future for poor children, we focus on improving access so they can attend school
    regularly, close to home.</p>
  <hr />
  <h3><img src="/assets/images/focus-icons/food-security.svg" class="left" alt="Food Security" /> Food Security &amp;
    Income</h3>
  <p>In most rural villages, families depend on farming or animal herding for survival. Drought, flooding and disasters
    can severely affect food security, and parents struggle to feed their children. You'll help provide business
    opportunities, agricultural training and financial services to establish reliable sources of income.</p>
