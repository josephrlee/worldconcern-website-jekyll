Your church can help transform the lives of those struggling with the effects of extreme poverty.

Does your church desire to serve unreached people overseas? World Concern partners with churches to bring the love of Christ in action to the world’s poorest people. Take part in transforming lives in some of the most remote, difficult places in the world. Bring hope to communities struggling after war, disaster or oppressive governments.
