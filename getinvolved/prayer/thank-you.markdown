Thank you for sharing your prayer needs with us. Please know that we will lift up your requests and will continue with you in prayer. If you're able, please visit our [prayer request page](/getinvolved/prayer/) again and update us on any additional needs or answered prayers.

If you'd like to pray for World Concern, here are a few things we'd love to have you pray for:

* Please pray that God would continue to bless and protect the vulnerable children, moms, dads, and communities we're serving. The vast majority of them have no government assistance, and extremely limited or no access to healthcare.
* Many of them don't know Jesus… This is their greatest need (and ours), so please pray that God would use this to increase His ministry in these hard places.
* Pray that many – here in North America, in our families and communities, and in remote villages around the world, would turn to Him afresh, or maybe for the first time.

Thank you, and God bless you!

*—The Team at World Concern*
