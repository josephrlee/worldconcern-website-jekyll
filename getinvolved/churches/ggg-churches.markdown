  \     <h3>The gift of a goat provides sustainable income for Mugo’s family</h3>\n
  \     <p>After Mugo’s mother died, his father’s meager income did not bring in enough
  money for food, clothing, and school fees for his large family of seven children.
  Then Mugo received a goat through the Global Gift Guide and soon things got much
  better. The goat provided nutritious milk for the children to drink, with extra
  to sell for additional food. After it reached maturity, the goat bred and some of
  its offspring were sold for more income. Now, thanks to an ongoing source of income
  from his goat, Mugo dreams of going back to school and helping his dad provide for
  his six siblings. Your church can give 10 goats that produce sustainable income
  for only $430.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"/uploads/Mugo.zip\" class=\"secondary button

  \     <h3>Chickens help a widow feed her family</h3>\n      <p>It was a wonderful
  day when Grace received chickens through World Concern’s Global Gift Guide. The
  chickens lay nutritious eggs to feed her children, including 11-year-old Naipe,
  shown in this photo. Not only that, the chickens multiplied and produced enough
  eggs to earn money so Naipe and her siblings can attend school! The income from
  selling eggs pays for their school fees and books. Now her family not only eats
  well, each of her children is becoming educated and Grace is so proud of them. She
  is thankful for the chickens that helped her family immediately and continue to
  help them envision a bright future where they no longer live in poverty. Your church
  can change life for 10 families with a gift of chickens for $500.</p>\n      <p><a

  \     <p><img src=\"/uploads/KE18NarokCD082-web-Jackline.jpg\"/></p>\n      <h3>Jackline
  is cured of worms</h3>\n      <p>Thirteen-year-old Jackline ate as much food as
  she could, but she was always hungry and ashamed at the horrible noises her stomach
  made. The problem was—Jackline was starving to death. She had intestinal worms that
  were eating every morsel of food she swallowed and robbing her body of nutrients.
  Because of that, she was often sick and always in pain. Being sick made her so afraid
  that she often wondered if she would die. Then World Concern staff brought de-worming
  pills to Jackline’s school and she was cured for only 44 cents. It is hard to imagine
  that only one pill costing 44 cents could change everything in a girl’s life—but
  it did. That pill was God’s answer to Jackline’s prayers. Your church can heal 1,200
  children with the 44-Cent cure for only $528.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"/uploads/Jackline.zip\"

  \     <h3>Elizabeth’s village has clean, disease-free water to drink</h3>\n      <p>Elizabeth
  used to walk hours a day to fetch water for her family. The water she found was
  in a dirty pond where animals also came to drink. Her family was sick all the time
  from that water, but there were no any other sources. Then generous donors helped
  Elizabeth’s village dig a well so she and her neighbors can draw clean, disease-free
  water for their families to drink. That water has broken the cycle of sickness and
  the families in Elizabeth’s village are now healthy and strong. In addition to clean
  drinking water, the well provides water for irrigation and they are growing higher-yielding
  crops so they have more to eat. Your church can provide clean water for an entire
  village with a gift of $3000.</p>\n      <p><a href=\"/uploads/Elizabeth.zip\" class=\"secondary
