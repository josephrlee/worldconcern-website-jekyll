At World Concern, prayer is foundational to everything we do. We invite you to join us in praying for the people we serve in some of the most difficult, dangerous places in the world. Your prayers offer protection, healing, provision, and move mountains for those who are suffering and in need. 

We also invite you to rejoice with us and pray prayers of thanksgiving for all that God is doing and has done through your support of World Concern.
 
*Updated March 31, 2021:*
Right now, the people of Myanmar are facing incredible hardship, violence, and uncertainty after a military coup took place on February 1, 2021. Hundreds of civilians have been killed and the nation is once again on the brink of war. 

Please join us in praying for peace, restoration of democracy, protection of lives, and an end to the violence. 

We also ask you to pray for areas that are seeing a new surge in COVID-19 cases, including crowded urban areas in Kenya and Bangladesh. Health care is limited in these places, and social distancing is next to impossible. Please pray for health, safety, and protection of the most vulnerable. 

Thank you for your prayers.
