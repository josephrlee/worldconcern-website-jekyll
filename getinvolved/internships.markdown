sidebar: "## FAQs\n\n**Is this a paid internship?**  \nEach Intern will be offered
  a monthly stipend to help meet some of their living expenses.\n\n**When are internships
  available?**  \nWorld Concern will offer internships opportunities for one year
  starting either in summer or fall.\n\n**What is the application process like?**
  \ \n Applicants will start with completing an online application. The HR will set
  up an interview with those who qualify. Interviews will be conducted by a panel
  involving a HR rep, the Manager who will supervise the intern, and one other member
  of staff.\n\n**How many hours will they be working?**  \nCandidates will be informed
  ahead of time the number of expected hours per week.\n\n**What does a typical internship
  look like?**  \nEach Intern will be assigned to a specific department and a specific
  manager/supervisor. Managers will be expected to provide mentorship to the interns,
  and general supervision and support in their day to day work. The Intern Coordinator
  will meet with the Interns once per month for conversations and encouragement on
  vocation/calling, giftedness, and personal spiritual and leadership growth. The
  interns will also have a chance to do job shadowing in other departments and where
  possible within the different ministries within CRISTA.\n\n**Will World Concern
  provide housing?**  \nUnfortunately we do not have the resources to provide our
  interns with housing or transportation. However, we are available to answer questions
  and provide suggestions. For instance, interns in the past have chosen to stay with
  reputable host families in the area or rent an apartment together. World Concern
  will provide contacts of willing hosts when and if requested.\n\n**Does World Concern
  send interns to other countries?**  \nThis will depend on the project/departments
  the intern is undertaking. In case an international travel was to happen, the intern
  will be required to undergo all the security background checks and requirements.
  In some cases, the interns may be required to co-finance an international trip.\n\n**What
  are the program qualifications?**  \nCurrent undergraduate or graduate students
  and recent graduates are eligible for the internship program.\n\n**What kinds of
  academic backgrounds are you looking for?**  \nCandidates with backgrounds in all
  fields of study are welcome to apply. The strongest and most talented applicants
  will be placed within the organization in a position where they can learn and contribute
  with their current skill set."
