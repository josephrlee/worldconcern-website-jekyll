<img src="/uploads/FY20-FreeThem5k-Sponorship-Beneficiary.jpg" alt="Your sponsorship protects children from trafficking" align="left" class="large-4 medium-5 small-6" /> Trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar industry, with one in four victims being a child. The statistics can be overwhelming, but they don’t have to be … You can make a difference.

>“To the world you may be one person, but
to one person you may be the world.”  
— Taylor Hanson, musician

As a sponsor of the World Concern Free Them 5k, you can save little girls and boys from a life of slavery, exploitation, and trafficking.

Last year, attendees and sponsors like you saved 3,700 children from trafficking! **Will you join us this year to save more?**

We expect hundreds of virtual participants to join this cause on Saturday, May 9, 2020. We’ve set the fundraising goal at $100,000. And your sponsorship is vital in helping us reach that goal.

By sponsoring the Free Them 5k, you rescue children from the threat of trafficking, and you become a known leader in the fight against this horrific injustice. Please join us today!
