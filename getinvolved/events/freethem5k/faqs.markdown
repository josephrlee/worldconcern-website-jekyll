## The Questions

**What is a “Virtual” 5k?**

A “Virtual” event is one that takes place in a virtual community, online, rather than in person.

**What if I already registered for the Free Them 5k?**

Your registration is still valid and will be converted to a virtual registration. Don’t worry, you’ll still get your awesome 2020 Free Them 5k T-shirt and keepsake bib number for participating! Your registration fee is a donation to World Concern’s anti-trafficking programs. If you decide you no longer wish to participate in the virtual event, you can request a refund of your registration fee by emailing us at [info@worldconcern.org](mailto:info@worldconcern.org?subject=Free Them 5k Refund). 

**How can I help make this an awesome experience for all involved?**

Great question! In addition to sharing your personal fundraising page on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and via email with your network of friends, we invite you to share photos, videos, and updates on how you’re preparing for, raising funds, and spreading the word about the Free Them 5k in the event [Facebook group here](https://www.facebook.com/events/2908843806008555/).   

**I’m not an athlete. Can I still participate?**

Being an athlete is not a requirement. You will have fun walking, strolling or jogging the race. It’s also a great event for experienced runners.

**Can kids run?**

Of course! This is a super-fun event for the whole family, kids 5 and under run free!

**Can I take video or pictures**?

Please do! And make sure you share them on all of our social media outlets and use the hashtags #FreeThem5k #WorldConcern

**If I can’t attend, can I get a refund?**

Yes, please email us within the first 60 days of your registration at [info@worldconcern.org](mailto:info@worldconcern.org) to request a refund of your registration fee.

**What is a team fundraising page?**

A Team fundraising page is where you can invite all of your friends and family to join you in your efforts to fight child trafficking and communicate with them in one platform. Anyone that donates funds to your individual fundraising page will also show up here.

**What is an individual fundraising page?**

An individual fundraising page is where you can personalize everything from why you are doing the 5k to choosing your fundraising goal.

**Why $48 for a registration fee?**

$48 helps protect one child.
