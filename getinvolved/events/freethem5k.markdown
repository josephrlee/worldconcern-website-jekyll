  ## Fighting Child Trafficking

  What does your $48 do to protect a child from trafficking? Find out how your dollar is put to use to help protect vulnerable children across Southeast Asia.
background: In places like Nepal, Myanmar, and Laos, children are at great risk of
  trafficking. Many do not have someone to protect them or warn them about the lies
  of traffickers. Extreme poverty, little opportunity to earn an income, and no rights
  for children leave them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.

##How You Can Help

By signing up and fundraising for the Free Them 5k you’ll help keep them safe! Every $48 you raise will protect a child. You’ll help provide things like:

- Children’s Clubs where boys and girls can safely gather and learn about the dangers of trafficking
- Safe places and counseling for children who have been trafficked or suffered abuse 
- A community hotline that operates 24/7 to report suspected cases of child exploitation or abuse

With your help, we can fight child trafficking!
