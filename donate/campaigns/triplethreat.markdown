> Rahma and her children watched in horror — the crops that had barely had time to recover from a brutal drought were now about to be devastated by a plague of locusts! 

> In just a few hours, the horde of insects moved on … leaving behind bare dirt and denuded trees. There was nothing left for the livestock to eat … nothing left for Rahma and her children to eat. 

> *Thank God for you — together with World Concern, you reached out to Rahma’s family with emergency food to help keep them alive, fresh water for the village, and water containers for each family.*

Please help counter the triple thread of drought, locusts, and COVID-19 in Africa — sharing God's love and helping save lives worldwide. 

Please give what you can now.
