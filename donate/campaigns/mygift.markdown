**Sayfia and her children watched in horror as their crops were destroyed by drought and swarms of locust. Then they saw one after another of their herd of 50 sheep die. The one sheep they have left is too malnourished to provide any milk, and the children are starving. On a good day, Sayfia’s children eat a meal, but often there is no food to eat at all.**

With the Coronavirus raging through Africa, it’s only a matter of time before it reaches Sayfia’s village. Because their bodies are so weak from hunger, Sayfia worries that her children will not be able to fight this virus. She is afraid they will die. She is also afraid that she will die and leave them orphaned.

**Families like Sayfia’s need help to survive Coronavirus and the starvation it is causing.** You can provide food, clean water, and medicine today that will give them hope. With your help, they can make it through this global pandemic.

**Thankfully, friends have offered a 2x match that will double every gift given online through July 31.**

Will you please give today to rescue families like Sayfia’s from the triple threat of drought, locusts, and Coronavirus?

**Every $1 you give will become $2 in life-saving aid because of the match!**

Please give what you can now.
