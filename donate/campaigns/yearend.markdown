**You are among the most faithful** and generous friends of World Concern, and we warmly invite you to make your personal mark again today, through a special end-of-year contribution. 

Despite all the challenges that 2020 brought, God is still at work! Our ministry together is desperately needed. And, right now, we have a strategic opportunity to make an even greater impact for vulnerable children and families around the world. *We believe God has called us “for such as time as this!”*

Your gift today will DOUBLE to help:
* Feed 2x as many hungry families
* Deliver safe, clean water to 2x as many families in need
* Protect 2x as many vulnerable children
* And shine the light of Christ brightly at this important time.  

**Right now, a Matching Challenge DOUBLES the impact of your gift to meet the most critical needs and share the compassion of Christ with those in need around the world.**

*We must raise $365,755 by December 31.* Please prayerfully consider and give your best gift today. Thank you, and God bless you.
