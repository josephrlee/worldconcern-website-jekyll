One third of girls in the developing world are married before age 18; 1 in 9 are married before age 15.

* Child marriage threatens a girl’s life, her health, and her prospects for the future. Domestic violence is significantly more common in child marriages.
* More than half the girls in Bangladesh, South Sudan and Chad are married before age 18.
* Girls with higher levels of schooling are less likely to be married off as children.
* Educating adolescent girls increases the age of marriage in a number of developing countries.

Education gives a girl the tools she will need to make a living, to stand on her own, to choose her lot in life. And most importantly, it breaks the cycle of poverty!

**Just $50 provides a scholarship for an entire year of schooling. A girl in school is six times less likely to be married off before the age of 18.**

You are among our most faithful and generous friends. Please pray helping save young girls from a terrible fate, by giving a generous gift of scholarships — and give now. Thank you!
