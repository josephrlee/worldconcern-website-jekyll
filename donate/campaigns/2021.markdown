**Your gift today makes an immediate and lasting impact in the lives of children, moms, and dads who are in greatest need.** Beyond the end of the road, in the poorest, most remote places in the world, you’ll reach people with practical, tangible help, delivered in God’s love.

The thirsty will have clean water; the hungry will have plenty of food to eat, and the hopeless will find peace and reconciliation with God – thanks to your generosity.

With your gift...

*   A starving child will receive emergency food
*   A young girl will receive a scholarship to stay in school and avoid child marriage
*   A mom will receive a business loan and training to earn income and feed her family
*   A farmer will receive the tools, training, seeds, and equipment to grow thriving crops
*   Someone who has never heard the name of Jesus will learn about the Savior who redeems…

Your gift right now, combined with World Concern’s 65 years of experience, and unique model of empowerment and community-led development, will change a life—and set an entire village on a path of physical and spiritual transformation.

**Please pray and give your best gift. Thank you, and God bless you!**
