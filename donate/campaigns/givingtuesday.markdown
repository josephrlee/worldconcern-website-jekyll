**You can DOUBLE your impact in the life of a family living in extreme poverty, thanks to a special #GivingTuesday match!**

Today, your gift will DOUBLE through midnight on Tuesday, December 1, 2020 to make a tremendous difference in vital, life-saving ways: 

* To provide emergency food for families 
* To deliver safe, clean water to entire villages 
* To protect children from trafficking, child marriage, exploitation, and abuse 
* To empower parents to earn an income to care for their children 
* To share the love of Jesus and see lives changed for eternity! 

*Your generosity will go twice as far to help where the need is greatest, like in rural Bangladesh where Sokina, a young mom, has two hungry children to feed.*

>*Sokina’s family is locked down inside their tiny shack in a slum. Before the pandemic, she made $2.35 a day collecting fish. Sokina didn’t earn much—but it helped feed her crippled husband and daughters.* 

>*Now Sokina has no work. No pay. No food. Thankfully, friends like you intervened with emergency food for Sokina and other hungry families in her community.* 

>*“I believe this came from God for our survival ... otherwise, we may have died!” Sokina joyfully proclaims.* 

**Your gift today will save TWICE as many families like Sokina’s because of a special matching grant.**

Thank you for giving practical, life-saving help and sharing the love of Christ this #GivingTuesday.
