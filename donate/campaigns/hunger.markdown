Half of South Sudan’s population is experiencing severe hunger this year. Millions of families are on the brink of famine … 

Thank God for the 2x match that doubles your gift to provide Hunger Survival Kits for twice as many hungry children and families. 

**You can rush life-saving aid to families in need!**

Each Hunger Survival Kit provides immediate life-saving aid AND long-term impact and includes:   

* Emergency food to keep people alive right now: eggs, meat, fish, and nutritious vegetables TODAY 
* A farming or a fishing start-up kit that includes tools and seeds or nets and hooks 
* Training needed to grow nutritious food — for months and years to come.   

**You’ll give help today, help tomorrow, and you’ll help feed a family going forward.**  

This life-saving kit costs about $46 to provide to each family — but today because of the match, every $23 you give will provide a Hunger Survival Kit for a family!  Every $46 provides emergency relief for 2 families ... $92 for 4 families! 

Every gift DOUBLED provides twice as many Hunger Survival Kits. Please help save lives now.
