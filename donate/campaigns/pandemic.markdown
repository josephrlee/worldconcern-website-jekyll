The Coronavirus pandemic brought the developed world to a stand-still for months! Now it is predicted to ravage the least developed nations, unless we step up and help: 

➞ Refugee camps in Bangladesh are some of the most densely populated in the world — up to 8.5 times *more densely populated* than the Diamond Princess cruise ship where transmission of the Coronavirus was 4x faster than in Wuhan, China!  

➞ Displaced refugees are often overlooked AND face pre-existing challenges to accessing health services, with restrictions that keep them from much needed aid. 

➞ Haitian hospitals barely function without the threat of a pandemic. A lethal outbreak here would cause devastation. 

➞ Families in nations on lockdown can’t get to the market to sell their goods. After just a few days, they will not have enough food. 

***A crisis like this destroys already fragile economies and infrastructures!***

Thankfully, generous donors have offered to match every dollar donated up to $200,000 for a limited time, to help rush life-saving aid to impoverished communities amidst the pandemic.

You can help provide the following for needy families at risk right now:  

* Masks ... 
* Gloves ... 
* Hygiene products ... 
* Training in handwashing and sanitation ... 
* As well as emergency food and more. 

**Every $1 you give will become $2 in life-saving aid because of the match!**

Please give what you can now.
