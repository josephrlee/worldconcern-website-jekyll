It’s an uncertain time for us all … as we face concerns about our loved ones’ health, employment, finances, etc. 

Please know we are praying for you at World Concern! 

And please know — we continue the compassionate, Christ-centered work on behalf of vulnerable, hurting people around the world.  

Today ... we need your help! 

**Your gift today to the Emergency Critical Needs Fund will meet vital needs — to prepare and protect families from Coronavirus, and ensure that life-sustaining humanitarian aid and long-term assistance in the world’s poorest, hardest places continues.**  

Your urgently needed gift today provides:   

* Safe, disease-free drinking water ...   
* Hand-washing stations, soap, and hygiene kits to prevent viruses and diseases and keep families healthy ...  
* Medicine, emergency food, and more ...   

... All delivered with love and compassion.   

Please give what you can now. With much — and deserved — attention focused on the spread of the Coronavirus, giving is understandably down ... **which puts our important programs at risk.**

People in crisis around the world need your compassionate response today.
