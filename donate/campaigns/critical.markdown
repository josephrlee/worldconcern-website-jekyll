The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all our lives. In this time of uncertainty, we are drawn together and compelled to help others.  

As a faithful supporter, you want to do something to help. You want to spread the love of Christ to areas that are at high risk when this virus reaches their community. With much—and deserved—attention focused on the spread of the Coronavirus, **World Concern’s vital programs and the poorest families in the most remote, hard-to-reach places we reach are at great risk.**  

You’re needed – now more than ever – to reach little ones, moms, and dads with life-saving help.  

**Your gift today to the Emergency Critical Needs Fund will meet vital needs – to prepare and protect families from Coronavirus, and ensure that life-sustaining humanitarian aid and long-term assistance in the world’s poorest, hardest places continues.**  

Your urgently needed gift today provides: 

* Safe, disease-free drinking water 
* Hand-washing stations, soap, and hygiene kits to prevent viruses and diseases and keep families healthy 
* Medicine, emergency food, and more 

All delivered with love and compassion.  

Please join us in praying for provision and protection for the most vulnerable, and **please give your best gift today**.
