> Rahma and her children watched in horror — the crops that had barely had time to recover from a brutal drought were now about to be devastated by a plague of locusts! 

> In just a few hours, the horde of insects moved on … leaving behind bare dirt and denuded trees. There was nothing left for the livestock to eat … nothing left for Rahma and her children to eat. 

> *Thank God for you — together with World Concern, you reached out to Rahma’s family with emergency food to help keep them alive, fresh water for the village, and water containers for each family.*

**Thankfully friends have offered a 2x match that will double every gift given online by June 30.** 

Please help counter the triple thread of drought, locusts, and COVID-19 in Africa — and make double impact to share God's love and help save lives worldwide. 

**Every $1 you give will become $2 in life-saving aid because of the match!** 

Please give what you can now.
