<img src="/uploads/2x-water-droplet.svg" alt="Your Gift Doubles!" class="small-3 medium-2 right"> **Water is foundational ... by providing access to clean water, you are working to end poverty and suffering — and save children’s lives!**
 
For people who have no access to fresh water, you can provide clean, safe drinking water through a variety of means, depending on the context and the need: 

* Wells 
* Rainwater catchment systems on schools, homes, community buildings 
* Household water filters 
* Protecting (capping, adding pumps) existing wells 

You’ll also help communities install latrines, learn proper hygiene, and improve sanitation. All dependent on clean water. 

It takes an average of just $20 to provide clean water for one person — but today your gift will be DOUBLED, and every $20 will provide for two people! 

***How many will you help today with the life-saving gift of safe, clean water?***
