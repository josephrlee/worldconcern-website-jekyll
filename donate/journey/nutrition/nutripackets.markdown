Severe drought in Somalia has led to a hunger crisis. 
Crops are unable to grow and mothers have no way to feed their children. Without a way to find food, moms in Somalia are praying for a miracle.

**Every $11 you give will feed a child like Safa with life-saving nutripackets for an entire month**.

Full of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, these powerful packets can save a child’s life. Without these packets, little ones suffering from malnourishment have little hope for survival. 

**Your gift of nutripackets today will let each child know and experience God’s love in the most tangible way.** 

And from the moment a mom squeezes the paste into her child’s mouth, the powerful nutrition you provide goes to work—just in time to restore the child to health. 

Please give now to feed a starving child.
