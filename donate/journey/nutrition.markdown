* In the world’s poorest places, 1 in 3 people suffer from hunger and malnutrition?

* Severe drought has wiped out most of the food supply in Somalia?

* Proper nutrition in the first 1000 days of a child’s life is critical for development?

Thankfully, there’s something you can do to save children in Somalia from starving.
 
**Emergency nutripackets are filled with a peanut-paste that contains all the essential vitamins, fats, and minerals a child needs.**

And it only takes a few weeks of eating these packets for a child to begin to gain weight and grow again! Soon the hunger pains go away and the nutrients get to work, restoring the child to health. 

Now, children once at-risk of starvation have a new chance at life. 

Give emergency nutripackets today to save a starving child.
