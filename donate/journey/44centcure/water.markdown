Clean water is critical for survival. 

Children who live in drought-prone or remote, poor villages are making dangerous journeys in hopes of finding water. But often the water they do find, if any, is dirty and filled with bacteria. 

Access to clean water changes everything.

**You can give clean, life-giving water to a family today with a water filter that only costs $39.** You’ll provide water that’s safe for Naishorua to drink, and in the most effective way possible. 

A water filter is a powerful solution for families without clean water. Dirty water pours into the top of the filter, and safe, disease-free drinking water comes out!

Your gift of clean water today will let each mother, father, and child know and experience God’s love in the most tangible way. 

Without clean water, many children and their families will continue to get sick.  

**You have the opportunity to break this cycle of sickness with a gift of a water filter.** 

Please give the gift of clean water today to save children, families, and communities in great need.
