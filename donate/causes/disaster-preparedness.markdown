body_title: Help Families Survive Disasters
---

Earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts and other natural hazards in poor countries lead to tragic loss of life and resources. World Concern empowers communities by helping them understand and evaluate their own risks, then develop a plan of how to be prepared. 

Your donation will build strong and resilient communities that are able to stand on their own, through:

* Early Warning Systems that alerts people to an imminent threat.
* Safe & Secure Shelters to protect and save lives.
* Public Awareness Campaigns to access weather bulletins, emergency kits, and important news.

Please give to help families survive disasters.
