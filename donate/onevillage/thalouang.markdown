With your support, the village of Thalouang will be transformed into a thriving, self-sufficient community with clean water, ample food, and healthy children.

Your monthly gift of $39 or more will help provide:

1. Water: You’ll help ensure families have access to clean water and the sanitation and hygiene training they need to stay healthy.

2. Protection: You’ll bring opportunities for youth to learn about safe migration and to learn valuable job skills to use at home.

3. Food: You’ll help make sure families have enough food to eat by providing farmers with training and tools to grow enough food year-round.

4. Income: You’ll provide opportunities for women to form savings groups to save for their families’ futures.
