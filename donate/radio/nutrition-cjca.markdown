In places like Somalia, where floods and locust swarms have decimated the food supply, moms have nothing to feed their children. Little ones are starving and need nourishment immediately to survive.  

**It costs only $11 to provide emergency nutrition packets to a malnourished child for an entire month.**

Each Nutripacket is full of vital nutrients, minerals, and vitamins that begin to work right away, restoring a starving child to health.
