In places like East Africa, where floods and locust swarms have decimated the food supply, moms have nothing to feed their children. Little ones are starving and need nourishment immediately to survive.  

**It costs only $11 to provide emergency nutrition packets to a malnourished child for an entire month.**

Each Nutripacket is full of vital nutrients, minerals, and vitamins that begin to work right away, restoring a starving child to health.
