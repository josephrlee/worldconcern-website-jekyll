Approximately 40% of the world’s children are affected by intestinal parasites, usually caused by dirty water and poor sanitation. Parasites can cause blindness, malnutrition, disease and even death.

**Just 44 cents will provide a dose of medicine that will cure one child of parasites.** 

For every $132 you give, 300 children will be cured of parasites. They’ll receive access to clean water, a sanitation system, and latrines will be installed.
