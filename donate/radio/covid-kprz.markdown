In places like Somalia and Northeast Kenya, disaster upon disaster has decimated the food supply, and little ones are starving. Their malnourished bodies are extremely vulnerable to sickness and disease, and COVID-19 is spreading through these countries. 

It costs only $131 to provide a COVID-19 Survival Kit. Each “Kit” includes:

* A hand-washing station for a remote village in the Horn of Africa
* 30-day supply of Nutripackets for one child
* Access to clean, safe water
* Education on hygiene, hand-washing, and sanitation to prevent the spread of sickness and disease
