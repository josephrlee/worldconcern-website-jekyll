Intestinal parasites enter a child’s body when they drink contaminated water or don’t wash their hands after going to the bathroom. 

The resulting stomach pain is excruciating. Other symptoms include severe diarrhea&nbsp;... and the inability to keep food down.  

**Worms can cause a child to be malnourished, to experience stunted growth and developmental delays, to miss school and ultimately be trapped in poverty.**

But today, you can provide medicine that cures a child of painful worms&nbsp;— it costs just 44¢ per life-saving dose.   

***Every $4.40 will cures 10 children and restores their hope for the future!***

* **50 children can be cured with a gift of $22 ...**
* **100 children can be cured with a gift of $44 ...**
* **300 children can be cured with a gift of $132 ...**
* **Whatever you give today will make a life-saving difference.**

Please commemorate the one-year anniversary of your first life-changing gift to World Concern by changing 10 young lives&nbsp;— with the 44¢ Cure.
