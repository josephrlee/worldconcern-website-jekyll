Clean water is essential — it’s the world’s single most precious commodity.

With the generous support of caring friends like you, World Concern provides clean water by a number of methods, each specifically tailored to the local situation. As you stand with us today, you will be part of …

* Digging and repairing wells.
* Constructing rainwater catchment systems.
* Creating reservoirs to hold clean water.
* And more …

In Pagisi’s village in Uganda, for instance, the local stream was the water supply, but the water was contaminated by bacteria that made the villagers sick — 

Then World Concern stepped in with a project that “protects” the natural spring water: 

Our 4-pronged response made a difference! Someone like you helped us:
1. Put barriers in place to prevent contamination at the source ... 
2. Set up a process for treating the water&nbsp;...
3. Created a safer way to distribute the water&nbsp;... and&nbsp;... 
4. Trained people in the village to test the water and take care of the&nbsp;system.

Effective and creative solutions like this open doors to transform lives in some of the poorest, most vulnerable communities. Many of those we serve live in drought-affected and remote areas, but they’re able to survive&nbsp;— and thrive&nbsp;— because friends like you invest in getting them access to safe, clean life-saving drinking water.

**It takes an average of just $20 per person to give the life-saving gift of clean water.**

Will you give someone clean water today?
