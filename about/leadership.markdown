  name: Nick Archer
  title: President
  bio: |-
    Nick Archer’s 40 years of acclaimed global development experience span four continents and include 22 years of service at World Concern in a myriad of different leadership roles, including Vice President, and Acting President. He passed with Distinction, a Masters in Rural Society Development from the University of Reading, England. He holds certifications in International Development, Security Management, and Conflict Resolution.

    As President of World Concern, Nick manages and oversees financial and business development strategies for the ministry, while representing the organization’s interest and programs with various partner agencies, consortiums, associations, churches and donors.

    “We have the privilege of serving some of the most vulnerable people around the world at a time when conflict and climate change are undermining people’s ability to not only provide a meaningful future for their families, but even survive,” explains Nick. "Poverty, in its myriad forms, continues to extinguish the dignity of many, rob children of their childhood, and consign people to a life without hope. Our work is to stand alongside those we serve, and reflect in what we do, how we do it, and what we say, the love and grace of God at the point of peoples' need.”

    Nick and his wife Lisa have two grown children and three grandchildren.

  name: Peter Macharia
  title: Senior Director of Operations
  bio: |-
    Peter has served with World Concern in a number of capacities over the past 10 years, including as a regional grant writer, country director for South Sudan, Kenya country director, Africa regional disaster response director, Africa Area Director and currently as Senior Director of Operations.

    Peter’s post-graduate studies in geography and sustainable development attained in Kenya and the Netherlands, combined with nearly two decades of experience in development, have equipped him with skills to serve in this capacity.

    “It gives me a great sense of fulfillment to see the lives of poor individuals and communities transformed to abundance,” says Peter. “We work with marginalized and vulnerable communities to help them overcome poverty, build their resilience to disaster and climate change, and achieve holistic development. I am blessed to support such a dedicated team working so hard to create sustainable water systems, develop community managed financial institutions that bring affordable and convenient financial services to the very poor, and improve food security and nutrition to impoverished families.”
