<p style="font-size: large;">It’s an unprecedented time in history. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all our lives. We are all aware of the challenges we’re facing as individuals, families, and as a global community.</p>
 
<p>In this time of uncertainty, we are drawn together and compelled to help others.</p>
<p>At World Concern, it is our priority that in everything we do, we lift up the name of Jesus and glorify God. Our ministry is focused on reaching, protecting, and serving the most vulnerable people in the hardest places in the world. It’s also focused on ministering to our supporters, partners, and staff.</p>

For the past several months, as the virus has spread into the areas where we’re working — crowded refugee camps and remote villages — we’ve taken critical steps to protect and assist those we serve. Our field teams are working under very challenging conditions — many under orders to isolate at home themselves. Some remain separated from their families by closed international borders and cancelled flights. Yet they are finding ways to reach those in greatest need and deliver urgently needed supplies and vital information on how to prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus.

In the midst of these challenges, we are also working to maintain life-changing and life-sustaining programming — nutrition programs for children, delivering clean water in villages, empowering parents to earn income, and sharing the love of Christ with the hopeless. 

In areas where operations are affected, we’re seeing evidence that our model of empowering communities to work toward their own transformation is effective.

<p>More than anything, we want to continue serving these vulnerable communities, some of which depend on humanitarian assistance to survive. Please pray that God would use this to increase His ministry in these hard places.</p>

<p>If you feel led, please prayerfully consider giving to ensure critical, life-saving work can continue in places of greatest need beyond the end of the road. You can give online here:

With hope in Him,
