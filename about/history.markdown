With a mission of equipping and empowering people to transform their own lives and communities, World Concern has been serving people in need in the world’s poorest places for 60 years.

In 1955, physician Wilbert Saunders and pharmacist Jim McCoy founded Medicines for Missions, the precursor to World Concern, and began supplying medicines to clinics and hospitals overseas. In 1970 Medicine for Missions officially joined CRISTA Ministries and several years later, became World Concern.

World Concern reached a turning point in 1976\. After delivering relief supplies to Guatemala in the wake of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, it became clear that after the initial crisis is over, giving handouts and then leaving was detrimental to the long term development of a country.

World Concern began sending qualified professionals and dedicated volunteers to work alongside the poor, helping them improve their standard of living and quality of life. World Concern’s work expanded to include emergency relief in response to famines in Bangladesh and Africa, a hurricane in Honduras and an earthquake in Nicaragua.

World Concern’s significant responses of the last decade include relief and recovery work after the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, and a life-saving response in Myanmar to rebuild communities after Cyclone Nargis in 2008\. World Concern supported refugees from the Darfur region of Sudan who fled into Chad during the Darfur war, as well as currently resettling displaced families in Chad.

World Concern also has an extended response in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. More than 100,000 people received assistance. The earthquake disaster response and long-term development in Haiti is one of World Concern’s most significant projects.

For the past six decades, World Concern has continued to provide excellent service to the world’s poor. In some of the most dangerous places in the world, where suffering and disease are at their worst, World Concern continues to bring relief and hope to those in need.
