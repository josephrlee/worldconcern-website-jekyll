banner_subtitle: Thongkouang is a tiny village of about 1,000 people in rural Laos.
  Families here have lived in extreme poverty for generations. Parents struggle to
  earn enough to feed their children, who often forego their education in order to
  work and help support the family.

story_copy: "#### Life in Thongkouang, Laos\n\nEveryday, Paatput, like many women
  in Thongkouang, spend up to four hours a day collecting dirty drinking water from
  a water source in the hills outside of her village. Although she knows that the
  water she collects for her family is not clean, she has no other option and hopes
  one day to have a well near her home with clean water for her family to use. “I
  am scared of all of the snakes and mosquitoes,” Paatput explains about having to
  use the field outside of her home as a restroom at night.\n\nWithout access to a
  proper latrine or clean drinking water, Paatput and her family are at greater risk
  of contracting malaria, dengue fever and water-borne illnesses such as severe diarrhea,
  all of which people in her village commonly have. \n\n“I need to have a latrine
  at my house so that my family is not sick,” she says."

<p class="large">Situated just a few miles from the Thai border—a gateway to Thailand’s dangerous and notorious sex tourism industry—the village is a target for traffickers who lure young girls and boys with deceptive offers for work. Many children and families migrate to Thailand, only to disappear and never be heard from again.</p>

Although it rains at certain times of the year in this area, there is little or no access to safe drinking water. Moms are forced to scoop contaminated water from murky streams. Without toilets or an understanding of good hygiene, many children are sick from water borne diseases. 

You can help change all this. With your support, the village of Thongkouang will be transformed into a thriving, self-sufficient community with healthy, safe, educated children. [Your monthly gift of $39] (/donate/onevillage/thongkouang) or more will help provide:

1. Income opportunities and improved farming techniques so parents can feed their children 
2. Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene training
3. Education for children
4. The establishment of youth centers to protect children from trafficking and keep them safe

[For $39 a month] (/donate/onevillage/thongkouang), you will make a powerful and significant investment in the lives of struggling families.

Hope is coming to Thongkouang ... Through your support, **you’ll walk alongside families here, as together, we see One Village Transformed.**
