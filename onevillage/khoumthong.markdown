banner_subtitle: Khoumthong is a tiny village of just under 400 people in rural Laos.
  Families here have lived in extreme poverty for generations. Parents struggle to
  earn enough to feed their children, who often forego their education in order to
  work and help support the family.

story_copy: "Kalia is just 18-years-old. She is already married with two children
  and takes care of her aging parents. Having grown up in the small village of Khoumthong,
  Laos, and for a long time, her worldview did not reach far beyond the three-mile
  long dirt road that led to villages beyond her own. \n\nMarried at 13-years-old
  and in search of better work to support her growing family, Kalia, like many other
  young girls her age, crossed the nearby border into Thailand. \n\n“We do not have
  enough money or food to eat,” Kalia explains about some of the daily struggles she
  faces at home. \n\nIn order to provide food and income for her family, Kalia often
  spends months at a time in Thailand working 15-hour days under the control of demanding
  and threatening bosses. On top of the already poor working conditions, Kalia is
  also at great risk of being trafficked. Without any better option, however, Kalia
  continues crossing the border."

<p class="large">Situated just a few miles from the Thai border—a gateway to Thailand’s dangerous and notorious sex tourism industry—the village is a target for traffickers who lure young girls and boys with deceptive offers for work. Many children and families migrate to Thailand, only to disappear and never be heard from again.</p>
 
Although it rains at certain times of the year in this area, there is little or no access to safe drinking water. Moms are forced to scoop contaminated water from murky streams. Without toilets or an understanding of good hygiene, many children are sick from water borne diseases.
 
You can help change all this. With your support, the village of Khoumthong will be transformed into a thriving, self-sufficient community with healthy, safe, educated children. [Your monthly gift of $39 or more] (/donate/onevillage/khoumthong) will help provide:

1. Income opportunities and improved farming techniques so parents can feed their children 
2. Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene training
3. Education for children
4. The establishment of youth centers to protect children from trafficking and keep them safe

[For $39 a month] (/donate/onevillage/khoumthong), you will make a powerful and significant investment in the lives of struggling families.

Hope is coming to Khoumthong ... Through your support, **you’ll walk alongside families here, as together, we see One Village Transformed.**
