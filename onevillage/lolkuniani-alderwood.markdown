banner_subtitle: |-
  Lolkuniani village sits on the outskirts of northern Kenya, a community steeped in tradition and struggling to provide food and clean water for their families and livestock.<br/>
  <br/>
  Families are hungry, consistently missing at least one meal a day as they try to keep their livestock—their main source of food and income—alive without enough food and water.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Women in Lolkuniani walk up to six hours a day to dusty riverbeds to dig for water—water filled with bacteria, disease, and debris. Children live with cramping bellies from drinking this unclean water. And with little exposure to the Gospel, the community is searching for hope beyond themselves. <br/>
   <br/>
  The people of Lolkuniani are ready for change, change Alderwood Community Church prays to see. The transformation of Lolkuniani village from a life of uncertainty to one of joyful abundance is only possible with you.

  They are sick because of the water they drink. And Nolkeresi is worn out from hauling
  it.\n\nJust imagine walking for six hours every time you need to get water for your
  family to drink. That’s how long it takes Nolkeresi to get water for her family
  of eight children. She leaves home at 5 a.m. to walk to a sandy riverbed where she
  digs with her hands until she sees a small pool of water. \nThen she scoops the
  water into her 5-gallon jerrican, one cup at a time. When it is full, it weighs
  more than 40 pounds. Carrying this, she walks home in time to make lunch for her
  children and give them something to drink.\n\nAs hard as it is to get water, the
  saddest part of this story is that the water Nolkeresi brings her children is contaminated
  with bacteria and parasites. It often makes them sick. Nolkeresi knows this, but
  there is nothing she can do about it. \n\nBut you can change that. By partnering
  with Nolkeresi and her village of Lolkuniani, you can provide water in the way that
  best meets their need. That may be a village well, a home water filter, or emergency
  water supplies. The water you provide will be safe for her children to drink, and
  they will be healthy!"
