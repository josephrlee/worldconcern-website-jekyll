  same name as Chad''s capital city) have spent most of their lives toiling to meet,
  what many would consider, basic human needs: water, food, shelter, and health. Unfortunately,
  for these families, the process of obtaining such things has been a life-long struggle.'

  #### Achta’s Story

  **A Life of Loss and Suffering**

  As she talks, tears softly stream from Achta’s eyes and roll down her previously upturned cheeks.

  “I was born in N’djamena Village. I was married in N’djamena Village. Four of my children died in N’djamena Village. Then the Janjaweed came and we lost everything we owned.”

  With a disheartened look across her face, Achta quietly says, “I have never known the reason why my children died. The hospital is a two-day journey by donkey. By the time we got to the hospital, they were already too sick. Maybe they died because of the dirty water...”

  Achta proceeds to explain that by the time the Janjaweed, an armed group of rebels, came to her village, she was still healing from the death of her four children, and “It was too hard as a mother to see your children dying.”

  The Janjaweed, known for their merciless killing, burning, and looting of villages across Sudan and Eastern Chad, invaded N’djamena Village in 2007, killing 20 people and leaving the village an empty shell of destruction.

  According to Achta, “When they came, we ran from our village. But every village that we went to turned us away. We eventually ended up in Gassire camp.”

  Achta, her husband, and her eight children remained in Gassire for six long years, returning to N’djamena Village only months ago.

  When asked why she would rather return to her destroyed homeland than live in a place of safety with clean water access, Achta promptly responded, “We would rather die in our own lands than in the camps.”

  Upon returning from Gassire to N’djamena Village, Achta discovered that everything she had ever owned or worked for had been demolished or stolen – homes, livestock, goods, tools.

  “We only had small food upon our return. I worked on a nearby farm to get some small amounts of millet to feed my family.”

  Exhibiting profound strength and tenacity, Achta and her family were slowly able to rebuild their home. They are now farming their own land and, along with other returnees, praying for a bountiful harvest season.

  In an attempt to create a sense of normalcy as she settles back into life in the village, Achta dreams of furthering her five children’s education.

<p class="large">You can help us reach children and families in the village of N’djamena. We’ve got a plan and experience bringing long-term change to villages like this that includes food security, education, better health, and a future beyond extreme poverty.

Sometimes you might feel powerless to help people suffering in poverty. The problems seem too big. Our perspective: We can’t change the whole world, but together, we can see One Village Transformed.

World Concern’s campaign matches you with the community of N’djamena Village, for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

The Janjaweed, an armed rebel group known for their merciless killing, burning, and looting of villages across Sudan and Eastern Chad, invaded N’djamena village in 2007, killing many people and leaving the village an empty shell of destruction.

<img src="/assets/images/stories/achta-ndjamena-alt.jpg" class="left" alt="Actha"/>They fled to a camp for displaced families called Gassire, where they spent the next six years.

“In Gassire we had no food. We could not farm our own land,” said a mother named Achta.

Last year, these families returned to their village with nothing… Though the population of N’djamena is less than half the size of what it once was, families continue to return because, “We would rather die in our own lands than in the camps,” said Achta.

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in N’djamena Village, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.
