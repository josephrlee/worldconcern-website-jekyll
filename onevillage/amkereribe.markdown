  #### Mariam's Story

  Eleven-year-old Mariam was too young to remember the attacks on her village during the Darfur war. But she has heard from her father, the chief of Amkrereribe, that it was a horrific experience. Armed men on horseback, called Janjaweed, stormed into the village, setting homes on fire and shooting innocent people.

  “I heard they killed people and stole all our cows and goats,” she said. “My father’s cousin died.”

  Mariam’s family and others from Amkrereribe fled to Gassire, a camp for families displaced by the violence. After living in the camp for several years, they have returned to their village to rebuild their lives from scratch.

  Each day, Mariam travels by foot or donkey for an hour to the nearest wadi (a shallow water source) to gather water for her 10 siblings and her parents.

  “The water here is dirty. Cows drink from it too,” said Mariam. “Many people have been sick from the water. I have had stomach pains and have been sick myself from the water.”

  None of the children in Amkrereribe go to school because there isn’t a school anywhere nearby. Mariam says she learned to read and write a little bit when she was living in Gassire, but now she’s forgotten these skills.

  “I would like to go to school,” she said.

  Mariam and her siblings eat one meal per day, but she admits, she’s hungry most of the time. The millet (grain) they had stored up is gone now, and farming families like hers have no resources to plant new crops.

  By [partnering with One Village Transformed in Amkrereribe](/donate/onevillage/amkereribe), you’ll help change all of this. Clean water, education, and sustainable farming are all part of the plan for this village. [Join World Concern](/donate/onevillage/amkereribe) and witness the transformation in Mariam’s village.

World Concern’s campaign matches you with the community of Amkereribe, Chad, for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

<img src="/assets/images/stories/amkereribe-yaya.jpg" alt="Yaya and his children" class="right" /> The tiny village of Amkereribe barely a blip on a map of Eastern Chad. When the 90 or so families that call Amkereribe home returned this past year, they found nothing but devastation. Their homes and farms were destroyed during the Darfur conflict. Men on horseback, armed with guns and flaming torches, rode into their village, intent on evil. They lit every home on fire and killed anyone in their path.

Survivors found themselves in desolate camps for the next few years. But eventually the food in the camps ran out…

The families of Amkereribe are thankful to be home, but without help, they won’t survive another dry season. They have no tools or seeds to plant crops. Children here are not in school, and the nearest water source is an hour’s walk away.

“Our children are sick, but we don’t know what the problem is,” said Halime, a young mother holding a newborn in her arms. “We use rainwater to farm and drink, but now the rain has stopped and we have no water.”

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Amkereribe, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.

“Even if life is hard here, we are working to farm and hope to have food. We will just stay and see what God will do,” said Yaya, a father of 7.
