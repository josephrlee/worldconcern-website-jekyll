banner_subtitle: "Thalouang is a remote village in southern Laos that sits near the
  Thai border. <br/> \n<br/>\nWith job opportunities hard to find, youth cross the
  border into Thailand as a last resort. Many are never seen again. Labor and sex
  trafficking are a horrific reality for families in Thalouang. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe
  villagers who return or decide to stay struggle to carry the burden of surviving
  without enough food, clean water, or hope for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies
  in Thalouang don’t have enough money to send their children to school. Instead of
  learning in classrooms, most kids look for work to help their families survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe
  people of Thalouang are ready for change. The transformation of this community from
  lives of uncertainty to ones of joyful abundance is only possible with you."

story_copy: "##Peng's Story\nPeng collects murky water from a mud puddle near her
  home. \n\nWhen she offers a drink to her young children, they complain it tastes
  sour. Sour, dirty water is all she has to give them.\n\nPeng doesn’t have enough
  money to keep hunger pangs away for herself and her kids. To earn money as a single
  mother, she hunts for frogs and then rides a tractor half an hour away to sell them
  at the market. \n\nBut Peng still doesn’t have enough money for food.\n\n“Sometimes,
  I feel tired and hopeless,” is all she can say.\n\nPeng dreams of feeding her children
  enough to satisfy them. She hopes for a day when the water they drink is clean and
  refreshing.\n\nShe is still waiting. \n\nBut with you, a new future is possible
  for Peng. A future with clean water, food for her family, and hope for the future.\n\nBy
  partnering with Peng and her village of Thalouang, you can provide water and income
  opportunities in the way that best meets their needs. \n\nThat may be a home water
  filter, savings groups, or farming training. The support you provide for Peng and
  her family will bring health and hope."
