banner_subtitle: Surrounded by jagged hills, the isolated village of Tessou sits in
  a flat, open, and seemingly endlessly arid stretch of land – vulnerable to most
  everything, natural and man-made alike. About 300 families sleep under fragile grass
  huts. They are constantly sick from the water that they travel for hours each day
  to gather. There is no school here; in fact, no one knows how to read or write.

  #### Amereran's Story

  **"Even if we are going to die here, it is better to work hard and get our own food."**

  Thirty-year-old Amereran was in her early twenties when the Janjaweed first attacked. Reflecting on that horrific day, she shares, “When the Janjaweed came they killed people and took our goods. They put fire on our houses. It was so bad that we had to leave.”

  Amereran has lost nine of her family members to the Janjaweed.

  Eventually they made their way to Gassire IDP (Internally Displaced Persons) camp in Goz Beida (a full day’s journey away), where they remained for the past 10 years.

  Though the camp provides its residents with safety, clean water, and education, it allows no space for personal farming; in other words, the IDPs cannot grow food for themselves. Their lives in the camp are not self-sustaining.

  According to Amereran, “In Gassire, the life was very hard.” Without personal land for cultivation or food distributions, Amereran and the other the IDPs remaining in Gassire faced a threatening food shortage.

  Though she knew that to return with her family of seven was to face certain insecurities, Amereran longed to be in her homeland, “Even if we are going to die here, it is better to work hard and get our own food.”

  The people of Tessou are capable. They are strong, skilled individuals who, given the proper resources, will rebuild their village in a heartbeat.

  This is evident in Amereran’s confident words, “Now I am feeling very happy to stay in my own place. I get to work to get food for my family. In Tessou we are living in peace and life is better.”

  [Your partnership with World Concern’s One Village Transformed project](https://donate.worldconcern.org/ovt-tessou "Donate Now") will help ensure Amereran’s family has clean water, enough food, and hope for the future.

You can help us reach children and families in this village. We’ve got a plan and experience bringing long-term change to villages like this that includes food security, education, better health, and a future beyond extreme poverty.

Sometimes you might feel powerless to help people suffering in poverty. The problems seem too big. Our perspective: We can’t change the whole world, but together, we can see One Village Transformed.

World Concern’s campaign matches you with the community of Tessou, Chad, for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

Since 2004, the Janjaweed (armed militia) have attacked Tessou three times; each time killing, stealing, and burning people, animals, and property.

After the first attack on Tessou, survivors were forced to flee for their lives – carrying only the clothes on their backs and hiding in the bush for weeks. Eventually they made their way to a camp for displaced families, where they have remained for the past 10 years.

Eager to farm and re-claim their land, families have finally resettled in Tessou and are starting over with nothing. All of their livestock were stolen by the Janjaweed. Thus, they have turned to farming – a trade that is challenging in an incredibly harsh environment.

Children are constantly sick from the water that they travel for hours each day to gather. They have no school; in fact, no one knows how to read or write. And they still live in fear that the Janjaweed may come again…

<img src="/assets/images/stories/tessou-abdel.jpg" alt="Abdel" class="left"/> “I hope that one day I will be able to build a home so that my family will join me from the camps. I pray that Tessou will one day be large as it was before,” said Abdel, an elderly man born and raised in Tessou.

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Tessou, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.
