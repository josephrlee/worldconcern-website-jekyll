banner_subtitle: Teetering on the steep and rocky mountainsides of southeastern Haiti—the
  poorest nation in the western hemisphere—sits the tiny village of Lestage. Because
  of its location, this extremely impoverished community is vulnerable to the constant
  threat of natural disasters such as hurricanes, landslides and flooding. These environmental
  issues, along with the lack of food, water and poor health care, threaten the lives
  of children and families here. Though resilient in their ability to survive the
  challenges they face and continually rebuild, the people of Lestage are in desperate
  need of long-term, sustainable solutions.

story_copy: "Michelle and her husband haven’t eaten yet today. It’s close to 3pm and
  they’ve spent the day struggling to tend to the lifeless soil outside their small,
  one-bedroom home in Lestage village. Years of deforestation and other natural disasters
  have ruined what was once fruitful terrain. Desperate for even a few beans and some
  corn to sprout, Michelle examines the cracked soil for any sign of life. It’s difficult
  to imagine that this same dry, rocky land once overflowed with an abundance of coffee
  beans and other crops that gave them food and a steady income. \n\nToday, they have
  neither. \n\nIn the afternoon, Michelle walks to the nearest water source—an unprotected
  pipe in the mountain. Because the water is contaminated, Michelle and her family
  are frequently sick. And with no money, they can’t even to visit the health clinic.\n\nAlthough
  they are grateful to live within a few steps of Lestage’s small church, sadly, both
  the church and pastoral staff are ill-equipped to meet the tremendous spiritual
  and physical needs of this community. They meet with others here regularly to pray
  for help. \n\nThe foundation for transformation exists in Lestage and people like
  Michelle and her husband are ready for change. They just need someone like you to
  be the answer to their prayers."
