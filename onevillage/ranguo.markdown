  story_title: Mary&rsquo;s Story
  story_column_one: |-
    Mary spends her days working long hours under the heat of the sun cultivating a small plot of land. Without the right tools and proper training, Mary is barely able to produce enough food for her large family.

    Only two of Mary’s children are able to attend the nearest school – almost two hours away – while the others help her farm at home.
  story_column_two: "When there’s not enough food to eat, Mary and her family will
    often go for days without eating. Despite her daily hardships and struggles, Mary
    is hopeful that she and her family, and the rest of her village, will one day
    have a better future. \n\nYou can help this dream become a reality for Mary when
    you partner with her and the rest of the community in Ranguo."

Every day is a struggle for the 3,600 people living in Ranguo village in rural South Sudan. Amidst its barren exterior and the thick, tall grasses that surround this desolate place, is a community in need.

Mothers and young girls walk hours each day to fetch dirty pond water, while farmers produce barely enough food for their families to eat even one meal a day. Children, unable to go to school, regularly go hungry and become sick without clean water or enough food to eat.

But things are changing in Ranguo… With your support and the support of other village sponsors, clean water, food, education, and the Gospel of Christ are bringing hope and transformation to this village.
