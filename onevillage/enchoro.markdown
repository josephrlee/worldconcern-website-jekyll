banner_subtitle: Enchoro is a Maasai village that is home to about 320 residents.
  Located in rural Kenya, Enchoro is far removed from basic necessities like health
  care, clean water, and access to education. The majority of Enchoro’s residents
  are pastoralists. Unfortunately, both humans and livestock suffer from the difficult
  land. Enchoro is persistently affected by droughts and far from watering sources.
  Families struggle to earn enough from their small herds to survive.

  <h3>Noosalash's Story</h3>
  <p>“I find life in this village quite tough,” shared Noosalash, a 40-year-old mother of eight who lives in Enchoro. “There is no water and often there are droughts. The latter part of last year only one spring had water. Everyone was coming to draw water there. So I went without water—even for my children—for two days.” </p>
  <p>Like all of the women in her village, Noosalash never had the opportunity to receive a proper education. Noosalash was married by the age of 10 and immediately transitioned into the role of motherhood. Her childhood was cut short for a life of responsibility no young girl should be forced into. </p>
  <p>Though she does not harbor bitter feelings about her upbringing, Noosalash believes in something more for her children. </p>
  <p>“I plan to send all of my children to school through doing odd jobs—making beads, selling my livestock, and other types of casual labor,” declared Noosalash. </p>
  <p>Noosalash has hope for the future of her community. “I want this village to develop. I want us to have a school,” she said. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, no matter the commitment of her labor of love, there is a strong chance that Noosalash’s children will have to cut their education short. </p>
  <p>Your support will change that. By partnering with the village of Enchoro, you’ll help open up opportunities for her children to go to school, and for Noolash to earn enough income to support her family. You’ll change her future, and the future of this community.  </p>

You can help us reach children and families in this village. We’ve got a plan and experience bringing long-term change to villages like this that includes food security, education, better health, and a future beyond extreme poverty.

World Concern’s One Village Transformed partnership matches you with the community of Enchoro for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

Women in Enchoro walk for miles across the windy plateau and over hills to reach a water source. During the frequent droughts that plague this area, there is only one small spring that has water. Women line up each day, hoping there is water left when it’s their turn to draw water from the spring.

Other times, a murky pond shared by animals is the closest water source.

According to 28-year-old Rose Pesi, Enchoro’s primary school teacher, “It’s tough to be a teacher in this school because we don’t have enough classrooms for our children. We have two classrooms and there are four grades. The greatest need in this village is to get extra classrooms for our children.”

After finishing grade 3, many students drop out of school, repeat a grade, or walk to the nearest town with a better equipped school.

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Enchoro, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.
