  story_column_one: |-
    Mary is a mother of seven in Aluelweng village in South Sudan, and she’s just weeks away from giving birth to her eight child.

    “It’s tough being pregnant here. You still have to do a lot of heavy work,” Mary shared. “You’re the one to fetch water, cook, collect firewood and take care of your small children. This is a big challenge.”

    There isn’t a hospital near Aluelweng, so Mary has taken the four-hour journey by food to the local hospital only two times during her pregnancy. She doesn’t feel safe making the long walk for more prenatal appointment because she feels too vulnerable.

    “We also don’t have a hospital here,” Mary said. “We have to go to Kuajok (which is about 4 hours away on foot). Walking all the way to Kuajok and back to handle all the heavy manual work can cause other problems and make you sick again, because it’s happening at a time that you’re vulnerable.”

    “I’m supposed to see the doctor one last time before I deliver, but the hospital visit is cumbersome and there is no one to take care of my children when I leave,” Mary said.

    Mary dreams of day when she and her family can see a doctor and get the care they need right in or near Aluelweng. A healthier, more abundant life is possible for Mary and others with your support.

Hidden amidst teak and mahogany forests in the remote north of South Sudan, is Aluelweng village, a vulnerable community of 750 families – generous in spirit yet desperate for change.
 
Though fertile soil abounds, a lack of farming knowledge keeps most families from producing enough food to eat. And clean water is nonexistent. Mothers walk for hours each day to scoop filthy water from murky puddles, knowing it will make their children sick. With no school nearby, children stay home, unable to learn to read or write. And with no local church, the community is seeking hope beyond themselves.
The people of Aluelweng are ready for change. The transformation of Aluelweng village from a life of extreme poverty to one of joyful abundance is possible with your support.
