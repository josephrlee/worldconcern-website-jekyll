banner_subtitle: "Barefoot children in tattered clothes trudge through piles of garbage
  and mud puddles that line the pathways of the community of Hindu Para in rural Bangladesh.
  The nearly 500 families that live here occupy rusting tin huts where up to six people
  often share one bed. Families here are constantly sick from contaminated water and
  food. \n\nConsidered some of the poorest people in their country, residents of Hindu
  Para are in desperate need of help. Most families cannot afford to send their children
  to school and instead are forced to marry their daughters off at a young age. Women,
  whose job it is to care for the family, are left to fend for themselves while their
  husbands travel to find even two or three days’ worth of work. Unable to provide
  enough food for their families, most people eat only a handful of rice and vegetables
  a day. Their situation is dire and the people of Hindu Para need your help."

story_copy: "Maleka is tired. With a sleeping baby in one arm and another child pulling
  at her side, it’s easy to see that this young mother of four boys, who doesn’t even
  know her own age, has lived a life well beyond her years. Unable to afford their
  own home, Maleka and her family live in a small room attached to her father-in-law’s
  house. Of her four children, who are often sick with high fevers, stomach pains
  and body aches, Maleka can only afford to send one of her sons to school. \n\n“We
  are just barely surviving,” she explains about the health and state of her family,
  “We struggle without enough food to eat…this is my reality, you can see how difficult
  my life is.”\n\nWhen her abusive husband disappears for weeks at a time, Maleka
  spends her days fearing his return. Although she tries to take out loans to help
  support her family and treat her baby’s pneumonia, she has not been successful.
  “In my suffering no one comes to help me…no one even listens to me,” says Maleka.
  \n\nGod has not forgotten Maleka, or the people of Hindu Para, however. And with
  your partnership, they will experience true transformation and realize their full
  potential."
