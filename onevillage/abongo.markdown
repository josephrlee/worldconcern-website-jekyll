  story_title: Rebeccah&rsquo;s Story
  story_column_one: |-
    Rebeccah is 15 years and lives in Abongo village. Like many children in her village, Rebeccah spends most of her days on her feet, walking long distances. She walks two-and-a-half hours each way to get to the nearest school and then two more hours each day fetching water for her family. As the oldest child, it’s Rebeccah’s responsibility to help her mother take care of the rest of their family.

    The nearest water source that Rebeccah frequents at least four times a day is a mucky hole in the ground filled with murky brown water teeming with insects and diseases. Rebeccah and the rest of her family are often sick with an upset stomach, severe diarrhea, and other water-borne illnesses.
  story_column_two: |-
    Unable to filter their water, visit a doctor or clinic for medical help or access a different water source, Rebeccah will continue to spend her days collecting the same dirty water that is making her family so sick. Although she is hopeful that tomorrow will be better, she knows that it likely won’t be.

    This is where you come in. You can help give Rebeccah and her entire village hope for their future.

Every day is a struggle for the 1,900 people living in Abongo village in rural South Sudan. Amidst its barren exterior and the thick, tall grasses that surround this desolate place, is a community in need.

Mothers and young girls walk hours each day to fetch dirty pond water, while farmers produce barely enough food for their families to eat even one meal a day. Children, unable to go to school, regularly go hungry and become sick without clean water or enough food to eat.

But things are changing in Abongo… With your support and the support of other village sponsors, clean water, food, education, and the Gospel of Christ are bringing hope and transformation to this village.
