banner_subtitle: "Barefoot children in tattered clothes trudge through piles of garbage
  and mud puddles that line the pathways of the community of Parulia Para in rural
  Bangladesh. The nearly 150 families that live here occupy rusting tin huts where
  up to six people often share one bed. Families here are constantly sick from contaminated
  water and food. \n\nConsidered some of the poorest people in their country, residents
  of Parulia Para are in desperate need of help. Most families cannot afford to send
  their children to school and instead are forced to marry their daughters off at
  a young age. Women, whose job it is to care for the family, are left to fend for
  themselves while their husbands travel to find even two or three days’ worth of
  work. Unable to provide enough food for their families, most people eat only a handful
  of rice and vegetables a day. Their situation is dire and the people of Parulia
  Para need your help."

story_copy: "Serena was just 15-years-old when she had her oldest daughter, Lija,
  who was born with severe physical disabilities that prohibit her from using her
  arms or her legs. For the past eleven years, Serena has not only literally carried
  her sweet daughter on her back with her wherever she goes, but she’s managed to
  raise two other children as well. Exhausted, Serena is unable to help her husband
  earn any additional income since her entire life revolves around caring for Lija.
  \n\n“We don’t have any money,” Serena expresses, as she points to the room that
  she and her family of five share with three other families. “No matter what,” she
  says, “my children will always bring me joy.” It’s impossible to imagine how Serena
  makes it through a single day. With a four-month old baby to care for, a 6-year-old
  who is no longer able to attend school because her family cannot afford it, a husband
  who barely earns enough to feed his family once a day and Lija, Serena is not sure
  how her family will continue to survive. \n\n“We don’t have a toilet and our water
  is not clean,” Serena explains after mentioning that her six-year-old son suffers
  from frequent stomach aches and water-related illnesses. \n\nSerena and her family
  are certainly among ‘the least of these,’ however, God has not forgotten about them
  or the community of Parulia Para. And with your partnership, they will experience
  true transformation and realize their full potential."
