  #### Ajong's Story

  Ajong has lived in Magai all of her adult life. Although she’s unsure of her age, she thinks she has lived here about 12 years. She is one of five wives to her husband, and the mother of five young children.

  With no source of income, she feeds her children from her small farm. Right now, as the growing season has just begun, she has no food left from the last harvest. She used to be able to sell one of her goats for money to buy food, but she has no goats left.

  “When we get really hungry, they eat leaves,” she said.

  Ajong says that many in her village are sick. There are no toilets—people here use the bush to relieve themselves, contaminating the soil and water with germs and disease.

  “The main sickness is diarrhea,” she said. Malaria and intestinal worms are also common, as are various skin diseases.

  None of Ajong’s children are in school because she cannot pay for school fees.

  You can help families like Ajong’s build better lives through farming, education, healthcare and clean water. Join One Village Transformed today.

<p class="large">Women do most of the work to grow food, but with no knowledge of farming techniques, they spend long days in the hot sun trying to plow small plots by hand on their knees. During the rainy season, the village floods frequently, destroying their hard work.</p>

Between harvests, most families eat just once a day, and many children are malnourished and sick. The nearest medical clinic is a 45-minute walk. The nearest school is an hour and a half away.

But there is something else that is unique in the village of Magai… a spiritual openness. People are hungry for God. As transformation takes place in this village, there is great potential for it to be at the heart level.

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Magai, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, equipping them with the tools they need so they can stand on their own.
