  <h2>One Church Transformed</h2>
  <p class="large">Westminster Presbyterian Church stepped out in faith to walk alongside the village of Harako, a community facing a desperate situation. To the delight of the Westminster congregation, Harako has blossomed in amazing ways. What they weren’t expecting was their church being transformed as well. Watch the video of how One Church and One Village were transformed.</p>

  <p>When the people of Harako, Chad returned to their village after the Darfur crisis, they found nothing. No sign their village ever existed. No means to rebuild. But through their own hard work—and with the support of World Concern and Westminster Presbyterian Church—the village has rebuilt and is now thriving.</p>

  Protecting Children\nTake a stand to protect the lives of children whose circumstances
  make them vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation and abuse, offering them safe
  alternatives and hope for a better future.\n    \n* ![Education](/assets/images/focus-icons/education.svg)
  \n### Education\nEducation is the path out of poverty. The families we work with
  know this, but many lack income to pay for their children to attend school. Provide
  ways for those in need to learn.\n    \n* ![Microfinance](/assets/images/focus-icons/training.svg)\n###
  Empowering Entrepreneurs\nSometimes all it takes is a spark to ignite hope in the
  heart of a woman living in extreme poverty. That spark can come in the form of a
  micro-loan and training to grow a successful business.\n    \n* ![Food Security](/assets/images/focus-icons/food-security.svg)
  \n### Feeding Families\nWe provide the necessary tools, training, and supplies for
  farmers to grow healthier, more productive crops, enabling them to feed their families
  and support a lucrative livelihood.\n    \n* ![Child & Maternal Health](/assets/images/focus-icons/child-health.svg)\n###
  Improving Health\nPoor health and poverty are intertwined, creating a cycle that’s
  difficult to break. We offer immediate help to those who are sick and suffering,
  and resources for better health to entire communities.\n    \n* ![Water](/assets/images/focus-icons/clean-water.svg)
  \n### Providing Clean Water\nIt’s one of our most basic needs as human beings, yet
  one person in nine lacks access to clean water. We’re working to change that. Clean
  water, sanitation, and hygiene go hand in hand to save lives."

When your church sponsors a village, you’re taking part in the transformation of a community in lasting ways. Working with village leaders, we help identify the specific needs of the village and the community takes part in its own transformation. Although each village is unique, some of the most critical needs in the areas where we work include:
