  story_title: Uduru&rsquo;s Story
  story_column_one: |-
    Life in Kuburchaj is not easy, and for Uduru and her three children, every day is a struggle just to survive. Outside of their small home are two graves—one of her husband, who died just one year ago, and the other of her youngest son, who died two weeks ago. A victim of a combination of malnutrition and water-borne disease, Uduru’s son’s small body simply could not fight the infection that inevitably killed him.

    A widow and grieving mother, Uduru is desperate to keep the rest of her children alive, but without any better options, is forced to continue feeding them contaminated water and leaves that she collects during the day.
  story_column_two: Sadly, Uduru’s story is not one of isolation, but is common for
    many living in Kuburchaj. Imagine the possibilities for Uduru and her family if
    you were to come alongside her, as a support and encouragement, giving her and
    her family access to clean drinking water, enough food to eat and an opportunity
    for her and her children to receive an education. Her life would change, your
    life would change and holistic transformation would invade her entire community.

An entire generation of residents in the village of Kuburchaj, South Sudan, have known nothing but hunger, sickness, loss, and war. Most everyone in this village of 1,900 families is so hungry, they are forced to eat leaves to survive. Their water source is a hole in the ground that fills every few hours with muddy water teeming with insects. There is no school or education for children here and more than 80% of the adults in the village are illiterate and have had no formal education. Families in Kuanya live on less than a dollar a day and are unable to send their children to school. The situation in this village is dire …
