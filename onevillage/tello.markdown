  story_title: Mary's Story
  story_column_one: "Mary carries a wooden cross with her wherever she goes. The cross
    is a physical reminder for her to be in constant prayer for her community. Whether
    she’s visiting sick neighbors in their homes or praying for others at church every
    Sunday, Mary a true prayer warrior. \n\nIn her village, there is obvious spiritual
    oppression and great physical needs."
  story_column_two: |-
    For a long time, Mary has been praying for change to come to her village. She prays for clean drinking water so that the children in her village are no longer sick, and looks forward to receiving pastoral and literacy training so that she can provide even more care for her community as well as mature in her own spiritual life.

    With your help, not only will Mary and her community’s physical needs be met, but their spiritual needs as well.

Every day is a struggle for the 2,400 people living in Tello village in rural South Sudan. Amidst its barren exterior and the thick, tall grasses that surround this desolate place, is a community in need.

Mothers and young girls walk hours each day to fetch dirty pond water, while farmers produce barely enough food for their families to eat even one meal a day. Children, unable to go to school, regularly go hungry and become sick without clean water or enough food to eat.

But things are changing in Tello… With your support and the support of other village sponsors, clean water, food, education, and the Gospel of Christ are bringing hope and transformation to this village.
