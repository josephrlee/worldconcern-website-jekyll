banner_subtitle: |-
  Kone Hsar village is located up a steep, winding hillside in eastern Myanmar, an isolated community looking for hope and eager for change.<br/>
  <br/>
  The families of Kone Hsar are a world away from neighboring towns and the vital roads needed to reach schools and health clinics. During the rainy season, pregnant women sit stranded up the steep mountain because the roads to a doctor are impossible to travel. And without a nearby school, children stay home for months during the rains, dreaming of returning to the classroom. Young children and elders go hungry because families can’t grow enough food to both sell and eat. They are isolated and distant from the help they need.<br/>
  <br/>
  The people of Kone Hsar are ready for a new leaf to turn in their lives—a transformation that is only possible with you.

story_copy: "##Bya Mar Lay’s Story\nBya Mar Lay is a mother of three in Kone Hsar
  village in Myanmar. She never went to school and knows her life would look different
  if she’d had the opportunity to go. \nWhen she thinks about her own young children,
  she hopes for a better future.\n\n\"If I could change one thing I would want my
  children to have a school to go in the village,\" Bya Mar Lay said. \"I want these
  children to have more understanding, and wide thinking.\"\n\nThere isn’t a school
  in Kone Hsar, so children in the village must travel to the city for schooling.
  For Bya Mar Lay’s family, this isn’t possible. The cost is too high and her husband
  doesn’t make enough money growing rice to pay school fees. \n\nBya Mar Lays dreams
  of a day when her children can go to school right in the village they call home,
  learning and growing toward a more hopeful, abundant life. A life that is possible
  with you."
