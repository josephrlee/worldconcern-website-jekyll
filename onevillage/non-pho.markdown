banner_subtitle: "Non Pho is a remote village in southern Laos that sits near the
  Thai border. <br/> \n<br/>\nWith job opportunities hard to find, youth cross the
  border into Thailand as a last resort. Many are never seen again. Labor and sex
  trafficking are a horrific reality for families in Non Pho. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe villagers
  who return or decide to stay struggle to carry the burden of surviving without enough
  food, clean water, or hope for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies in Non Pho don’t
  have enough money to send their children to school. Instead of learning in classrooms,
  most kids look for work to help their families survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people
  of Non Pho are ready for change. The transformation of this community from lives
  of uncertainty to ones of joyful abundance is only possible with you."

  for clean drinking water.\n\n“Some of the members in my family get sick when they
  drink the pump water,” Lang said. “They get headaches, fever, and body aches.”\n\nThe
  water Lang’s family drinks is not only brown and murky, but it’s filled with bacteria.\n\nIt’s
  making them sick. \n\nSome family members have been so sick from the contaminated
  water that they’ve needed to travel hours by tractor to the hospital.\n\nLang is
  ready for something new. He is ready for clean water.\n\nYou can give Lang clean
  water. By partnering with Lang and his village of Non Pho, you can provide water
  in the way that best meets their need. That may be a new pump, a home water filter,
  or emergency water supplies.\n\nThe water you provide will be safe for his children
  to drink, and they will be healthy!"
