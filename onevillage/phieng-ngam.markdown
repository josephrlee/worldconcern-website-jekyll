  Phiêng Ngàm is one of the most remote villages in all of Vietnam. Perched high on a mountain plateau and tucked into a dense, leafy forest, there are no paved roads leading to the forgotten community. <br/>
  <br/>
  Families in Phiêng Ngàm live on just $3 a day, and with only a single rice harvest each year, kids often go to bed hungry. Most babies don’t get the nutrients they need, and with their drinking water contaminated with lead, bacteria, and disease, children in Phiêng Ngàm are sick from water-borne Illness. <br/>
  <br/>
  You can change this. As a monthly sponsor partnering with Phiêng Ngàm village, you will walk with the families of Phiêng Ngàm as they move toward a more abundant life.

story_copy: "##Hoang's Story\nHoang is a young widow caring for her two small children
  in remote Phiêng Ngàm Village.\n\nShe farms a little plot of land to feed her boys,
  but it’s not enough to fill their bellies. \n\n“For us, it is normal to go to bed
  hungry,” Hoang says. “We don’t have enough to eat.”\n\nThe family uses a pipe to
  bring water in from the stream, but Hoang knows it’s not clean. She has headaches
  and stomach pains every day from drinking the dirty water. \n\n“It’s really difficult,”
  Hoang shares. “We don’t really know what to do.”\n\nHoang worries about her children’s
  future and health. Each morning she hopes for a day better than the last. But it
  can feel hopeless.\n\n“I have to take care of everything by myself,” Hoang says.
  “I have to do it all alone.”\n\nBut Hoang is not alone, and God has not forgotten
  her or the people of Phiêng Ngàm. \n\nTogether with you, they can experience true
  transformation and a future bright with health and hope."
