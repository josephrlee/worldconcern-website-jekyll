  #### Fatouma's Story

  #### "Our greatest need is clean water"

  For most of Fatouma’s 30 years of life, she has lived in the tiny village of Maramara in Eastern Chad. And for as far back as she can remember life has been a struggle. As a young girl, she remembers walking for hours to collect water. It’s a way of life here.

  As a mother of five children, she makes that same trek for water each day. If she is able to walk the three-hour distance to clean water, she knows her children will be healthier. But most days, she visits a closer water source. The water is dirty and often makes them sick.

  Her family collects firewood from the bush to sell in order to buy food. They also farm, so they have some beans, millet, or rice to eat.

  “Some days, we eat in the morning and in the evening, but most of the time, we eat only in the morning, then not again until the next day,” she said.

  Her youngest child, just 6 months old, squirms and tries to nurse on her lap as she talks about life in Maramara. His nose and eyes are runny—evidence this little one is not healthy.

  Most of the diseases Fatouma’s family faces are from the water, she says. Her own mother became sick—her stomach bloated and painful. They took her to the hospital in the town of Goz Beida, but she died after returning home.

  “We don’t have a choice to drink the water,” she said.

  But Fatouma would like to stay in Maramara. “As long as we are working, it is okay to stay here,” she said.

  [Your partnership with World Concern’s One Village Transformed project](https://donate.worldconcern.org/maramara "Donate Now") will help ensure Fatouma’s family has clean water, enough food, and hope for the future.

You can help us reach children and families in this village. We’ve got a plan and experience bringing long-term change to villages like this that includes food security, education, better health, and a future beyond extreme poverty.

Sometimes you might feel powerless to help people suffering in poverty. The problems seem too big. Our perspective: We can’t change the whole world, but together, we can see One Village Transformed.

World Concern’s campaign matches you with the community of Maramara, Chad, for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

In the isolated village of Maramara, nearly all of the 200 families have survived for decades by subsistence farming. When the rains come, there is enough food to eat. But the rest of the year, families are lucky to get by on one meal a day.

The nearest source of clean water is a three-hour walk—each way. Mothers often forego this burden and gather dirty, “bitter” water from a closer source. As a result, children are often sick with diarrhea and diseases like dysentery.

“There is no hospital nearby if children fall ill,” said Bourma Abduli Ahamed, the 80-year-old chief of Maramara.

There is also no school in Maramara, so children grow up without an education, trapping them in an endless cycle of extreme poverty.

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Maramara, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.
