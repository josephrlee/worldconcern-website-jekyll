banner_subtitle: Beyond the colorful cement walls, muddy pathways, and mucky fishing
  ponds that decorate the community of Uttar Shuhilpur are some 3500 families whose
  entire lives exist within this world. Haunted by extreme poverty in all parts of
  their lives, the people of Uttar Shuhlipur struggle to survive. Families here are
  constantly sick from contaminated water and food. Most families cannot afford to
  send their children to school and instead are forced to marry their daughters off
  at a young age. Women, whose job it is to care for the family, are left to fend
  for themselves while their husbands travel to find even two or three days’ worth
  of work each week. Unable to provide enough food for their families, most people
  eat only a handful of rice and vegetables a day. Their situation is dire and they
  need your help.

story_copy: "In the short 22 years that she’s been alive, Halema’s life has not been
  easy. Married off at a young age, Halema’s husband died in a road accident just
  two years ago when she was seven months pregnant with their second child. Often
  sick with high fevers and stomach pains, Halema is forced to leave her suffering
  children at home while she finds enough work to provide even one meal a day for
  them. \n\nAfter her husband died, Halema worked in construction as a brick layer,
  the only job she could get. Unfortunately, complications in her pregnancy landed
  her in the hospital for an emergency surgery. Today, Halema is not only left traumatized
  and with chronic pain from the surgery, but with medical bills that she cannot afford
  to pay back.\n\n “I only have pain in my life,” says Halema, “there is no joy.”
  \n\nHalema, who will likely never re-marry because of cultural shaming towards widows,
  is helpless and unsure of how her future can even look any different.  \n“It is
  only the work that I find each day that allows me to take care of my children that
  gives me hope to get through the day,” she explains. \n\nIn her pain and suffering,
  however, God has not left Halema. And with your support, Halema and the rest of
  her community will experience true transformation and realize their full, God-given
  potential."
