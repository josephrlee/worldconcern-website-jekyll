banner_subtitle: Teetering on the steep and rocky mountainsides of southeastern Haiti—the
  poorest nation in the western hemisphere—sits the tiny village of Bernard. Because
  of its location, this extremely impoverished community is vulnerable to the constant
  threat of natural disasters such as hurricanes, landslides and flooding. These environmental
  issues, along with the lack of food, water and poor health care, threaten the lives
  of children and families here. Though resilient in their ability to survive the
  challenges they face and continually rebuild, the people of Bernard are in desperate
  need of long-term, sustainable solutions.

story_copy: "With her 8-month old baby on her hip, a sack of beans balanced on her
  head, and a bucket in her hand, Sillion treks through rugged trails to collect water
  at the nearest water source—a contaminated and unprotected pipe in the mountainside.
  She knows the water is bad, but has no choice but to continue to give her children
  water that makes them sick. \n\n“Every few weeks we are at the hospital,” Sillion
  explains. She knows when her children are sick because they get stomach aches, a
  fever and their skin itches uncontrollably. “She gets pains,” Sillion explains,
  looking at her precious daughter who has already been sick with a high fever and
  stomachache this month. “I can see she is in pain with a fever…I feel so bad for
  her, it’s like I’m feeling sick when she is sick.”  \n\nSillion and her husband
  work hard to provide enough food for their family, but it is rarely enough. “We
  eat whatever we grow,” Sillion explains looking out at the dried up fields next
  to her home, “My children tell me they are hungry,” she says. In the past, Sillion
  and her neighbors grew coffee beans and other crops to sell and feed their families,
  today, however, after years of unrelenting floods, droughts and deforestation, the
  land is barren. “Please pray for enough food for us,” Sillion pleads as searches
  her garden for a few beans and some corn to feed her children tonight."
