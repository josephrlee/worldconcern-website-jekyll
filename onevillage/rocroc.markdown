  story_column_one: |-
    Rebecca currently lives in Roc Roc Village. But for many years, she and her family went from village to village, fleeing the ongoing violence that plagues her nation still today. It was this violence that eventually killed Rebecca’s husband who was a soldier at the time. Not only is Rebecca a widow, but she has lost four of her eight children from various waterborne illnesses as well as malnutrition.

    “We drink unclean water,” she explains, “…and the mosquitoes bite us openly without mosquito nets.”

    Rebecca spends her days collecting leaves and grass to sell and gathers dirty water from a nearby pond. Although Rebecca has recently become a Christian, she still worries for her children’s safety and health and knows that they are in danger of becoming sick, like her other children did.

    “I cannot read,” Rebecca explains, “…it is a person who can read who knows about the future, but for me, I just look up to God for everything.”

    While Rebecca’s steadfast faith shines as a light in her community that is in need of some of life’s most basic necessities, she needs encouragement from someone like you who will walk alongside her on the long journey towards holistic transformation.

Life for those in Roc Roc Village of South Sudan has not been easy. For years, the people have known nothing but hunger, sickness, loss, and war. Unable to harvest their fertile land because of frequent flooding, sickness, and lack of access to seeds, tools and other necessities, families are sometimes forced to eat leaves to survive. Their water source is a hole in the ground that fills every few hours with muddy water teeming with insects. There is no school for children and more than 80% of the adults in the village are illiterate and have had no formal education. Families in Roc Roc live on less than a dollar a day and are unable to send their children to school.

While the situation in this village is dire, the people here are eager for change…
