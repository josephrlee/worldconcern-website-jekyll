  story_column_one: |-
    In yester-years, I was very excited about life. We had lots of livestock and rain was falling twice a year. Those were my best times. I enjoyed life.

    When my husband died, life got tougher - he was the breadwinner and he knew many ways to get food for our family. Now that he isn’t around, the task is on me. It has been challenging.
  story_column_two: |-
    People don’t get food easily here.

    Several times my children have gone to bed hungry. It’s a bad thing to experience. It’s quite disturbing to me as a mother.

    I hope that one day my children will live a very good life and they will have enough livestock and good families.

Nkaroni village sits on the outskirts of eastern Kenya, a community steeped in tradition and struggling to provide food, healthcare, and clean water for their families and livestock.

Families are hungry, consistently missing at least one meal a day as they try to keep their livestock – their main source of food and income – alive without enough food and water.

Women in Nkaroni walk up to six hours a day to dusty riverbeds to dig for water – water filled with bacteria, disease, and debris. The local health clinic is rarely stocked with needed medicine, and children live with cramping bellies from drinking this unclean water. And with little exposure to the Gospel, the community is searching for hope beyond themselves.

The people of Nkaroni are ready for change. The transformation of Nkaroni village from a life of uncertainty to one of joyful abundance is only possible with you.
