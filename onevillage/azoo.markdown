  story_column_one: |-
    Sarah imagines a bright future for her seven children, but she is not sure if it will ever become a reality.

    Sarah has been through more than most in her 38 years, losing her husband and three of the 10 children she’s carried. Now a widow, she does what she can to build a better life for her seven surviving children – all on her own. She believes education holds the key to a richer life – for her children and herself.

    She farms her land and the land of others in the village to support her family, but it is still not enough. She scrapes together what she can to pay school fees, but only her three oldest boys go to school. She dreams of learning to read and write so she can be an example to her children.
  story_column_two: |-
    She often goes hungry in hopes her children have enough to eat, but many of her children lay down at night with rumbling stomachs.

    When Sarah is worried about filling her children’s bellies, there isn’t much time to think about education. But you can help change that.

    With you by her side, worries of hunger can be replaced by seeing Sarah and her children thrive in the classroom.

Located a two-week boat ride by river through the Congolese rainforest, Azoo village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is filled with rich resources, rolling hills, and a beautiful community of people.

But despite a surrounding of abundant natural resources, families in Azoo have been devastated by years of civil war that forced them deep into poverty.

The oil and minerals lining their land have been pillaged, leaving locals some of the poorest people in the world. There isn’t enough food for the families in Azoo, and their water isn’t safe to drink, either. And with no access to education, almost no one can read or write. Without schooling, women and young girls are the most vulnerable to violence.

The people of Azoo are ready for change. The transformation of Azoo village from suffering to a joyful, abundant, and free life is only possible with you.
