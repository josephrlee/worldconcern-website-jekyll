banner_subtitle: "Nonkhoum is a remote village in southern Laos that sits near the
  Thai border. <br/> \n<br/>\nWith job opportunities hard to find, youth cross the
  border into Thailand as a last resort. Many are never seen again. Labor and sex
  trafficking are a horrific reality for families in Nonkhoum. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe villagers
  who return or decide to stay struggle to carry the burden of surviving without enough
  food, clean water, or hope for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nFamilies in Nonkhoum don’t
  have enough money to send their children to school. Instead of learning in classrooms,
  most kids look for work to help their families survive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people
  of Nonkhoum are ready for change. The transformation of this community from lives
  of uncertainty to ones of joyful abundance is only possible with you."

  is for them to be healthy.\n\nBut without clean water, Haen knows her girls will
  keep getting sick.\nShe walks 20-minute to a small pond to fetch water. \n\nWater
  she knows is not clean. Water that makes her girls sick.\n\n“When we drink the water,
  we get sick with diarrhea and stomach pain,” Haen shared. “We try to treat our pains
  by boiling palm tree leaves in water, but it doesn’t help.”\n\nRecently, when the
  pain was overwhelming, Haen and her girls traveled to the health clinic to seek
  relief. With little money to spare, this trip to the clinic added more stress to
  the struggling mother.\n\nHaen knows her life would be different if she had clean
  water. It is all she wants for her daughters.\n\nYou can give Haen clean water.
  By partnering with Haen and her village of Nonkhoum, you can provide water in the
  way that best meets their need. \nThat may be a new pump, a home water filter, or
  emergency water supplies. The water you provide will be safe for her children to
  drink, and they will be healthy!"
