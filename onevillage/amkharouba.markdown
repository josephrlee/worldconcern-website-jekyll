banner_subtitle: The village of Amkharouba was once a thriving farming community.
  Families grew crops, raised animals for income, and lived in relative safety. Then
  one horrible day, evil came to their village… The Darfur war spilled over the border
  of Sudan and armed men on horseback (called Janjaweed) rode in, destroying everything
  in their path. Survivors fled to camps. Now, several years later, the families of
  Amkharouba have returned to rebuild their lives from scratch.

  #### Salouakatteer's Story

  Brushing back her bright yellow burka, Salouakatteer solemnly describes life in Amkharouba.

  Located an hour and a half walk from the nearest water source – both the land and the people of Amkharouba are in desperate need of water.

  Though unsure of her age, Salouakatteer appears to be around 10 – old enough to know that people in her village are dying from hunger and lack of clean, accessible drinking water.

  “The water we are getting is very far from here,” explains Salouakatteer. Most days, she spends the majority of her morning riding her donkey to and from the water collection site. “I go every day, unless sometimes my brother or sisters go instead. The water we are getting is not clean.”

  Salouakatteer and her six siblings often go hungry. “We eat one to two times a day. Yes, we are hungry everyday – sometimes we even cry,” she said. Salouakatteer can remember a few people in her village who have died from hunger.

  She may not have had much time to be a child during her formative years, but it is clear that Salouakatteer remains a child at heart. Just the mention of school brings a grin to Salouakatteer’s previously stoic face.

  “School is far from here so no one attends,” she explained. “But I want to learn about what kids learn about in school.”

  Salouakatteer has simple hopes for the future. “I’m hoping that one day we can get water and a school and food to eat every day.”

You can help us reach children and families in Amkharouba. We’ve got a plan and experience bringing long-term change to villages like this that includes sustainable sources of food, education, clean water, and a future beyond extreme poverty.

World Concern’s campaign matches you with the community of Amkharouba, Chad, for three years. With your support, we will work with the community to accomplish specific goals as they begin to see a better future emerge.

The families of Amkharouba are eager to rebuild their lives. But the needs are great, and they are focused solely on survival.

“The Janjaweed destroyed our whole community. Most people fled, but a few of us stayed,” said Kadir, a father and teacher who has lived his entire life in Amkarhouba. “Because of the lack of water, many have not returned. Without water, the children get sick. We have to take them by donkey to a hospital. We don’t even have a cart to transport them.”

“I go into the bush and cut firewood to sell at the market to get money for food. But most days, it’s not enough,” she said. “We only eat once a day. If I get extra money, I will buy some meat and rice. But most days, we just eat some grain.”

With you, World Concern will walk alongside families in Amkharouba, helping them build their lives and their community from the ground up. Together, we’ll focus on long-term solutions, so they can stand on their own.
