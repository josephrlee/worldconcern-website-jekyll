banner_title: Web of Hope, Laos
banner_subtitle: Web of Hope is a community of villages with just under 800 families
  in rural Laos. Families here have lived in extreme poverty for generations. Parents
  struggle to earn enough to feed their children, who often forego their education
  in order to work and help support the family. More than that, village youth are
  at risk of migrating to nearby Thailand in search of work, only to disappear and
  never be heard from again. And for those who do return, drug use, domestic violence,
  and HIV/AIDS have become a taboo topic that many struggle with but are unsure how
  to address. <br/><br/>The people here are trapped in a worsening cycle of poverty
  but are desperate to see change for their future generations.  You can help transform
  their community by partnering with King's Schools Social Justice Club as a One Village
  Transformed sponsor.

story_copy: "#### Life in Web of Hope Villages, Laos\n\nDown a long and winding road
  just a few miles from the Thai border is a web of villages, a community in need
  of hope. Children, who are often left at home for days and even weeks at a time
  while their parents search for work, meander up and down the dirt road looking for
  lizards to eat. Without access to clean water or sanitation, they often become sick
  and therefore are not always able to attend school. When they get a little older
  and are held responsible for caring for the rest of their family, their best is
  to leave their village in search of work in neighboring Thailand. \n\nFarmers have
  become defeated in their efforts to tend to the dried out and difficult land while
  mothers spend entire days searching for barely enough water to drink, which is often
  unclean. \n\nCommunity divides and broken households exist as a result of HIV/AIDS
  being introduced by men and women who’ve brought it back with them from their time
  in Thailand. Alcohol abuse, neglect of children and domestic violence all pose threats
  to the lives of those in Web of Hope villages who are barely surviving."

<p class="large">Situated just a few miles from the Thai border—a gateway to Thailand’s dangerous and notorious sex tourism industry—the village is a target for traffickers who lure young girls and boys with deceptive offers for work. Many children and families migrate to Thailand, only to disappear and never be heard from again.</p>

Although it rains at certain times of the year in this area, there is little or no access to safe drinking water. Moms are forced to scoop contaminated water from murky streams. Without toilets or an understanding of good hygiene, many children are sick from water-borne diseases. 

You can help change all this. With your support alongside **King's Schools Social Justice Club**, Web of Hope will be transformed into a thriving, self-sufficient community with healthy, safe, educated children and families. [Your monthly gift of $39] (/donate/onevillage/web-of-hope-kings) will help provide:

1. Income opportunities and improved farming techniques so parents can feed their children 
2. Access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene training
3. Education for children
4. The establishment of youth centers to protect children from trafficking and keep them safe

[For $39 a month] (/donate/onevillage/web-of-hope-kings), you will make a powerful and significant investment in the lives of struggling families.

Hope is coming to Laos ... Through your support, **you’ll walk alongside Web of Hope families, as together, we see One Village Transformed.**
