banner_subtitle: Education is the path out of poverty. The families we work with know
  this, but many live far away from schools and lack income to pay for their children
  to attend. We provide ways for those in need to learn.

body_intro: Kids living in poor villages or slums don’t have a chance without an education.
  Our programs often provide the only chance kids have to attend school in remote
  and underserved areas. Even skills as simple as reading and math offer a stepping
  stone out of poverty. Education equips children to reach their God-given potential—and
  see a life where they can dream big and plan for the future.

story_copy: "### Christine's Story\n\n#### Education is a Rare Gift  \nfor Girls like
  Christine\n\nUnlike most girls her age, 18-year-old Christine is proud to be one
  of the few in her rural Kenyan community to complete her education. For her first
  three years of secondary school she was the only girl in her class. “It was difficult,”
  she said.\n\nAccording to Christine, most girls her age are either married off young
  (some as young as 10-years-old) or cannot afford to pay school fees. When finances
  are tight, parents tend to pay for their sons rather than daughters.\n\nThough neither
  of Christine’s parents received an education, they understood the importance of
  educating their children. Having produced a family of seven, they struggled to generate
  enough income to pay for school fees. Even with land, livestock, and a small shop,
  school fees were still too much.\n\nWorld Concern saw their situation and reached
  out to help four of their children with scholarships.\n\n“It was through God that
  World Concern came and gave us scholarships,” said Christine’s mom.\n\nChristine
  is now a role model for many girls in her community. When I asked if other girls
  look up to her, a shy grin spreads across her face and she quietly responds, “The
  few girls in the area who are not married off are working hard so they can reach
  the level I’ve reached.”\n\nAfter completing computer courses, Christine will wait
  for the results from her secondary exams and then apply to university. “I want to
  become a dentist so that I can come back to the village and help others. One day
  I want to start a school to educate more girls,” she said. Christine’s role-model
  future is just taking off.\n\nWorld Concern is working to empower girls and boys
  around the world—like Christine—to take hold of their futures through education."

<p>You can help empower a child and change her future by supporting her education. It only costs about $50 to educate a child for an entire year in some areas where we work.</p>

    <span class="highlight">Village Schools /</span>
    World Concern helps isolated communities build classrooms and schools. In places where children walk for miles to the nearest school, or meet outdoors under a tree, a classroom provides shade from the sun and shelter from monsoon rains.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Scholarships /</span>
    It’s hard to imagine, but in most developing countries, school is not free. Poor families struggle to afford school fees, uniforms, and school supplies. World Concern offers scholarships for high school, and helps parents with young children pay
    primary school fees.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Opening Up a World of Sound to Hearing Impaired Children /</span>
    We provide hearing impaired students in Bangladesh and Vietnam with hearing assessments, hearing aids, and special classes to learn to communicate (some for the first time). Children are taught to hear their own voices and learn to speak, read and
    write.</p>
