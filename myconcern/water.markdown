body_intro: 'Water: It’s vital to sustaining life. We all need it to survive, yet
  nearly one billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. What little
  water is available is usually poisoned by dirt, parasites and sewage. It''s often
  the first and most urgent need we address in a community. We work closely with those
  we serve to determine the best way to deliver clean water to each community. World
  Concern constructs and repairs wells, water reservoirs, and rainwater catchment
  systems, creating access to clean water sources for thousands of people each year.'

  ### Hinda's Story

  #### How One Day of Rain Can Change Hinda’s Whole Life

  Hinda Yassin is a widow and a mother of seven children. She lives in Somaliland (Northern Somalia), where it rains as little as three days a year. The nearest water source to Hinda's home—a tiny, dome-shaped tent in the desert—is two hours away. She walks this every day.

  Thankfully, she has a camel to help her carry her jerrycans back home each day. But filling those cans requires scooping dirty water with a cup from a small hole in the ground. You can imagine how long that takes.

  In places like Somaliland where Hinda lives, digging wells is next to impossible. The water table is too low, or the water is salty. The only solution is a berkad—a giant underground tank that catches rainwater runoff. Here's what's really amazing: a berkad can fill to its capacity in one day of heavy rain, holding 70,000 gallons of water. This is enough to supply a small village with clean water for six months!

  Once the berkad is built, Hinda's whole life will change. She'll have water for her children—and for her neighbors. Plus, she can sell the water to others and earn a few hundred dollars a month. That’s lasting change.

We target the poorest, most vulnerable communities to receive water projects. Many of those we serve live in drought-affected and remote areas.

    <span class="highlight">Clean Water /</span>
    With you, we help deliver clean, safe drinking water to communities living without this life-saving resource. We dig and repair wells, and construct rainwater catchment systems and reservoirs to hold clean water. The water source depends on the
    specific needs of a community, and the availability of fresh water near the surface.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Sanitation /</span>
    Because clean water and sanitation go hand in hand, your support will also enable us to install latrines. However, in some cultures, using a latrine is completely unknown. To ensure healthy habits are formed, we train community members who in turn
    train others about the importance of using latrines to avoid contaminating the water.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Hygiene Training /</span>
    You’ll help teach people about the importance of hygiene for health. Hygiene trainers educate others about the importance of hand-washing to health. Through our programs, families are better protected from illness, including diarrheal disease, which
    kills 1.5 million children every year.</p>
