banner_subtitle: Sometimes all it takes is a spark to ignite hope in the heart of
  a woman living in extreme poverty. That spark can come in the form of a microloan
  and training for her to grow a successful small business.

body_intro: The dream of starting a business is prevalent in even the poorest countries.
  But it takes more than a dream to make it happen. Entrepreneurs need resources and
  training to make a new business prosper. But in many places loans are not regulated
  by the government or other authorities and money lenders may charge 50% to 100%
  interest. Women are often excluded from receiving loans because of discrimination.

story_copy: "### Bellia's Story\n\n#### Ignite Hope in the  \nHeart of a Woman\n\nBellia
  sells clothing and accessories at the market in Saint Louis du Nord in North West
  Haiti. She has received several loans from World Concern's microcredit program,
  and she is part of a group of 15 other small business owners, with whom she shares
  a large loan. The individuals in the group have the opportunity to support and encourage
  each other. “We meet every Thursday to share ideas and give advice,” says Bellia.\n\n“I
  use the loans to buy more products and grow my business,” she said.\n\nWith the
  income Bellia earns she is able to provide for her family. She has two children
  who are both in school. Bellia proudly shared about another important purchase she
  recently made. “I was able to buy land. I want to build a house on it so I don’t
  have to pay high rent,” she said.\n\nThere are many other vendors at the market,
  some who are also selling clothing and accessories. When asked how she has stayed
  competitive over the years she explains, \"With my wisdom.  I smile and offer a
  good price.\"  With a smile like this, how can she go wrong?\n\nYou can ignite hope
  in the heart of a woman like Bellia. Donate now and fund a microloan for a woman
  in need."

World Concern helps people overcome obstacles with fair lending practices, reasonable interest rates and training to help business owners succeed. We teach Biblical values in the marketplace to help ensure loan recipients run their businesses  ethically.

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Microloans /</span>
    We seek out heads of households—male or female—who would otherwise be unable to start their own business. Loan amounts range from less than $100 to more than $2,000. More than 95% of loans are repaid in full.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Financial Service Associations /</span>
    In places with little infrastructure, we help communities start village savings banks, or financial service associations (FSAs). FSA members can also borrow money to expand their businesses.</p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Savings Groups /</span>
    Like mini credit unions, smaller savings groups in rural villages enable members to save and borrow money. Members contribute a certain amount each week, then take turns borrowing and repaying loans.</p>
