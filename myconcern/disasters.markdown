body_intro: Living through a disaster is a terrifying experience, but the crisis is
  intensified when disaster strikes an already impoverished nation with little infrastructure
  and few resources for survival. Clean water, shelter, and medical care are among
  the immediate needs after a disaster. World Concern has the technical expertise
  to respond to disasters and decades of experience. With your help, we’re able to
  reach families impacted by disaster with life-saving aid.
who_we_serve: 'Most countries where we work are prone to disasters: flooding, hurricanes,
  typhoons, drought, earthquakes and war. When disaster strikes in a country where
  we work, we respond directly. As a member of <a href="http://www.integralalliance.org/"
  title="Integral Alliance">Integral Alliance</a>, an alliance of 20 Christian relief
  and development agencies, we also respond through partners to disasters in other
  countries.'

With long-term assistance, we help the poorest in a community—those who would otherwise have no way to repair their homes or find work, utilizing neighborhood committees to help determine which families have the greatest need.

<div class="panel">
<p><span class="highlight">Immediate Response /</span> Whether it be a hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, drought, or flood, World Concern responds to help save and protect families affected by disaster. Our staff distributed food, water, tarps and medical supplies to more than 100,000 people immediately following the Haiti earthquake. And when 13 million people were in need of immediate, life-saving aid during the Horn of Africa famine, we were uniquely positioned to provide food, water, medical care, and supplies to unreached hungry families. We couldn’t do any of this without the help of donors like you.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Rebuilding Lives /</span> We are committed to remaining in disaster-affected places until the lives of those we serve are stabilized. We’re helping rebuild lives in disaster-torn countries—one person, one family at a time.</p>
