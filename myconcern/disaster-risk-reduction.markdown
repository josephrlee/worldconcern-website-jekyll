body_intro: |-
  Climate change, population growth, and environmental destruction leave people vulnerable to disasters. Earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts and other natural hazards in poor countries lead to tragic loss of life and resources.<br/><br/>
  Flooded houses affect family health and stability. Damaged schools affect students’ ability to learn. Destroyed businesses and livelihoods worsen poverty. Lost crops mean people don’t have enough to eat. Although hazards like earthquakes and hurricanes are not preventable, we can reduce the impact they have on people’s lives.<br/><br/>
  World Concern empowers communities by helping them understand and evaluate their own risks, then develop a plan of how to be prepared. We build strong and resilient communities that are able to stand on their own.

  ### Pastor Charité's Story

  #### A safe place for families to worship and learn

  Pastor Charité is a pastor and school principal in the community of La Pointe, Haiti. His church of 100 people meets faithfully each week in the same local school building where Pastor Charité works. Each day, nine teachers educate the 178 students who attend the school.

  The school building was built by World Concern in partnership with the community. Pastor Charité pointed out the remains of the former school building which sat next to the new one. “The old building was very weak,” he explained.

  Each year, hurricanes sweep over the country, destroying anything in their path. A committee made up of parents, teachers, a school representative, and a local leader identified the construction of a new school/church building as a priority in reducing their vulnerability to disaster.

  Thankfully, the new building was up and operating just in time. Soon after construction finished, a large storm in 2012 destroyed the former building.

  Pastor Charité said, “This new building is much safer.”

  This new structure is a big step towards protecting this community from future disasters.

An empowered and prepared community is a safe community.  We work with local leaders and government agencies to develop evacuation plans, carry out trainings and form local emergency response teams.

<div class="panel">
<p><span class="highlight">Early warning systems /</span> are crucial to protecting communities and saving lives.  An effective system uses signs, sounds, words or images to tell people of an imminent threat so they can prepare and plan accordingly.  For example in Bangladesh, communities use a system of flags to warn residents of a storm or other threat.  Each flag represents a different level of danger informing people of what action to take.</p>
<p><span class="highlight">Safe &amp; Secure Shelters /</span> It is said that disasters do not kill people, buildings and other
hazards do. Ensuring buildings and other critical infrastructure like roads and bridges are secure can save lives.  We assist communities in retrofitting buildings and building emergency evacuation centers.  We also train local masons and builders how to use safe building techniques.
</p>
<p><span class="highlight">Community Education /</span> Public awareness campaigns in schools, health centers and churches help inform people about personal preparedness and how to easily access important resources in their community such as weather bulletins, emergency kits and relevant news.
