body_intro: 'It’s a simple formula: people living in extreme poverty need income –
  not handouts. They earn income from working, but in order to work, they need skills.
  Teaching job skills helps lift families out of poverty for good, changing the direction
  of generations to come.'

  ### John's Story

  #### Dignity and Self-Sufficiency from Learning a Valuable Skill

  John and his family witnessed and survived, South Sudan’s brutal civil war that destroyed what little infrastructure that was there. Despite the hard life he’s lived, an immense smile spreads across John’s face. This and his lanky six-foot-five figure make him unmistakably memorable. But what’s most memorable about John is the great sense of dignity and excitement that he exudes.

  Like many in South Sudan, John has spent the majority of his life struggling to provide an income for his family with no job skills. He has scarcely managed to feed his children. But because of the support of World Concern and donors like you, he has been given what every human being deserves—the opportunity to provide for himself and his family.

  Through World Concern’s vocational training program, John was trained as a mechanic. He fixes motorbikes in a little shop in the town’s main market. He’s even training others in order that they too can find work and provide for themselves. His dream is to own his own mechanic shop someday and employ others like those he trains.

  Empowerment to move past daily survival—this is what John, and others, have been blessed with. You can see on his face the effect of such empowerment—dignity, self-sufficiency, and joy.

Our vocational training programs carefully match the needs of a community with skills that are taught, to ensure students are able to use their skills and get a job after completion. We place a special emphasis on women in our vocational training
programs, as they are often treated unequally and expected to support their families. However, men and women of all ages have the opportunity to learn a skill through our programs.

  <p><span class="highlight">Mechanical Skills Meet Vital Needs /</span> In South Sudan, people rely on motorbikes for transportation, but many of them sit broken and abandoned. Through World Concern’s vocational training center young men learn mechanical skills so they can repair motorcycles for income, and at the same time, meet a vital need in the community. At this same school, young women and men learn to drive, giving them a highly sought-after skill and the ability to be hired as a paid driver.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Tailoring Clothing Provides Community Service /</span> In many communities where we work, people are not able to afford new clothes because they are imported from elsewhere. Our vocational schools offers classes in sewing and tailoring so women can make clothing, thereby earning an income and providing
    affordable clothing to their neighbors in their community.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Craft Skills Protect Children and Women from Trafficking /</span> In Southeast Asia, we protect children from being trafficked into slavery by giving them a basic education and job skills, such as sewing or jewelry making. Being able to earn income safely means they’ll be less likely to be lured by traffickers’ false promises of income. Adults also have the opportunity to learn sewing and computer skills so they can earn enough to educate and provide for their own children.</p>
