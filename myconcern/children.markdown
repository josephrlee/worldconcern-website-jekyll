body_intro: More than one million children are trafficked each year and sold into
  forced labor or the sex trade. Poor children are particularly vulnerable as they
  are often unsupervised by adults. Many feel obligated to help support their families,
  so they drop out of school at a young age and look for work. They are lured by traffickers
  who promise high-paying jobs in the city, but instead they become modern day slaves,
  exploited and abused.

  ### Duangmany's Story

  #### A Young Girl Now Safe from Harm

  When Duangmany was 15, she took a risk many girls her age are willing to take. She left home and traveled 12 hours to a small town outside Bangkok in search of work.

  Far from home, Duangmany ended up working in a small restaurant, preparing food and serving beers to male customers.

  “The work was very tiring. I had to get up early to prepare the meat,” she recalled of her experience. “I woke up early in the morning and worked late in the evening to clean and close the shop. I worked long hours and felt physically exhausted. When I requested a chance to rest, it wasn’t allowed. What I was earning was not enough for the work I did.”

  Although Duangmany says she was abused by the restaurant owners, she was attracted to the freedom to buy shoes and clothes with her money. But eventually, her body gave out and she wasn’t able to go on. She returned home with $6 in her pocket.

  When asked about the abuse she suffered in Thailand, Duangmany grew quiet. She refused to talk about the experience of serving beers to men, and when asked if she would ever consider going back to Thailand, she shook her head and said, “No.”

  After joining the World Concern vocational skills class and learning to sew, she has hope for the first time to earn enough income and to help support her family—in a safe way. And when other young girls talk about going to Thailand for work, she can tell them about the reality of what’s waiting for them across the border.

World Concern believes that prevention is the key to curbing the increase in child trafficking and exploitation. We work to keep children safe in their community by providing educational opportunities to the most vulnerable. We teach children about the dangers of trafficking, and how to keep themselves safe.  

<div class="panel">
  <p><span class="highlight">Awareness Training /</span> Through informal workshops and classes, children learn about child abuse, traffickers’ scams, and their rights as children.</p>
   <p><span class="highlight">Job Skills /</span> It is a harsh reality that in many poor countries, children leave home to find work to help support their families. We provide skills, like sewing, jewelry making, or motorbike repair, so they can earn income safely, close to home, and stay in school.</p>
  <p><span class="highlight">Education /</span> Children who are wandering the streets instead of being in school are vulnerable. We provide them with basic education opportunities and encourage them to stay in school.</p>
