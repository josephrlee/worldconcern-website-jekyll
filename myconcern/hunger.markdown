body_intro: Worldwide, one in nine people are hungry. Chronic malnutrition has stunted
  the growth of 178 million children worldwide, with the highest rates in Africa and
  Asia. Based on the specific needs and resources of each community, we help ensure
  families have sustainable sources of food—long term. Teaching people to grow their
  own food for consumption and income is a major step toward lifting themselves out
  of poverty. For these families, and many others, your support means they can eat
  today, and be able to feed their families for years to come. This is lasting change.

  ### Umar's Story

  #### Reaping a Harvest out of Nothing

  Umar Abakar is a father and farmer who returned home to Eastern Chad after the Darfur war to find his land completely overgrown with weeds and shrubs. With no plow or seeds, he had no means to restart his farm—the family’s only means of survival.

  Umar told us he was spending one day trying to clear his land, then hiring himself out to other farmers in order to earn enough money to feed his family that day. He was desperately trying to juggle these two back-breaking jobs.

  “When World Concern came here, I was in a total slump. I had nothing and was just trying to feed my family,” he said.

  We’re providing necessities like seeds (most families resorted to eating their stored seeds to survive the Sahel drought), plows, horses, and training to plant drought-resistant crops.

  Farmers are organized into farming groups, like co-ops, to share tools and resources. The system is working amazingly well.

  The sorghum that was just harvested was 10 feet tall. Healthy, vibrant crops like okra, sesame, and tomatoes are thriving.

  “Now, I will have enough to feed my family and sell some of our crops to make a profit,” said Umar.

who_we_serve: In some places around the world, families don’t have enough food to
  eat. Poverty, drought, disasters, and outdated farming practices all contribute
  to a shortage of food. Children become malnourished and, without enough food to
  eat and grow, many do not survive.

You can send emergency nutrition to feed a starving child today. You can also help families grow their own food long-term.

Depending on the culture and resources within a community, you’ll help meet specific needs and make sure families have enough food for years to come.

    <span class="highlight">Emergency Nutrition for a Child /</span>
    In places where children are hungry and malnourished, powerful nutrition comes in the form of emergency ‘nutripackets,’ full of essential vitamins and minerals that help nourish a starving child back to health. Each child receives a one to three month supply of nutripackets and is carefully monitored to make sure they grow and develop properly. </p>
  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Farming Support /</span>
    You can equip hungry families with long-term solutions to hunger and poverty. In addition to teaching farmers how to grow better crops, you’ll help teach the business side of farming. Families learn sustainable farming practices to produce steady sources of nutrition (and income) that will last for generations.
