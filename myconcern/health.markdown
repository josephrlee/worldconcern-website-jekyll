body_intro: 'Many of the causes of sickness and disease stem from poverty: drinking
  contaminated water, malnutrition, living in crowded conditions, exposure to communicable
  diseases, and lack of health care. Poor health worsens poverty as sick family members
  are unable to work and become a burden to those who are earning income. Nearly one
  billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. Lack of sanitation
  and basic hygiene also contribute to illness. Malnutrition plays a role in over
  half the deaths of children under 5 in developing countries.'

  ### Jharna's Story

  #### The Gift of Compassion

  When Jharna heard other young moms talking about a medical clinic in the slum where she lives in Bangladesh, she felt a glimmer of hope. She had never been able to afford medical care.

  “My life is not good,” said the 25-year-old mom of two, with anguish in her eyes. Her 7-year-old son was born with severe disabilities, including being blind and deaf. The weight of this is often too much for her to bear as a mom.

  Jharna works as a servant in a home, earning about $100 a month. Her husband is a rickshaw puller. They live in a shack in the slum with a tin roof that leaks when it rains. No toilet, no running water.

  “I have suffered for a long time,” said Jharna, who was extremely depressed when she came to the clinic. Here, she received immunizations to protect her from preventable diseases that are rampant in the slum. She also received family planning resources and health information, along with something inherently absent from her oppressive culture—compassion.

  “The staff here is friendly, and I’m comfortable sharing my health concerns with them,” she said. “I feel better. This is good for me.”

  Jharna now tells other young mothers in her neighborhood about the resources at the clinic. “It’s a safe place to go,” she says.
