Located a two-week boat ride by river through the Congolese rainforest, Azoo village in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is filled with rich resources, rolling hills, and a beautiful community of people.

But despite a surrounding of abundant natural resources, families in Azoo have been devastated by years of civil war that forced them deep into poverty.

The oil and minerals lining their land have been pillaged, leaving locals some of the poorest people in the world. There isn’t enough food for the families in Azoo, and their water isn’t safe to drink, either. And with no access to education, almost no one can read or write. Without schooling, women and young girls are the most vulnerable to violence.

The people of Azoo are ready for change. The transformation of Azoo village from suffering to a joyful, abundant, and free life is only possible with you.
